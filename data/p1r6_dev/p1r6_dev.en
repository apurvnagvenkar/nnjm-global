investigation results for yu qiuyu donation incident : he donated 30,000 books .
last night xiao rong , deputy director of the bureau of education of dujiangyan city , was exclusively interviewed on the phone by a reporter and " dispelled the injustice " against yu qiuyu .
three schools and 30,000 books .
xiao rong said that after many discussions , the following " gentleman 's agreement " was reached between the dujiangyan city education authorities and yu qiuyu .
the bureau of education of dujiangyan city would provide the namelists of three schools .
yu qiuyu was responsible for using the funds to donate 10,000 books to the libraries of each of the schools on the list , for a total of 30,000 books .
99 read was responsible for arranging for purchasing , distributing , and delivering the books .
the bureau of education of dujiangyan city also announced the three most recently confirmed schools that would receive the donations : puyang elementary , li bing middle , and dujiangyan city foreign language lab school .
the libraries of these three schools would be named " qiu yutu library . "
there are three questions to answer : why did donating " schools " turn into donating " books " ?
why did the first promise of donating 200,000 to build a hope school become 30,000 books ?
xiao rong said that when yu qiuyu visited the disaster area after the earthquake , he first did say that he wanted to donate 20,000 yuan to build a hope school .
but according to the requirements of the relevant authorities , the building requirements for the schools after the disaster were extremely high , and had to meet very high anti-vibration standards , so 200,000 was by far not enough to build one elementary school .
" and mr. qiu yu is a writer , a publisher , so we recommended that it would be better for him to donate corresponding books to fill up the school libraries . "
" they would be called ' qiuyu libraries , " and mr. qiuyu thought this was a good idea and happily agreed . "
yu qiuyu also said that if it was n't enough money , he would make up the rest .
why was it not announced until now ?
why did n't 99 and the local education autorities reply until after they had been doubted for so long ?
on this , xiao rong disclosed that rebuilding the school was a very complex systemic project involving school consolidation , address selection , and using the names of caring figures .
therefore , he recommended that yu qiuyu wait until permanent school buildings were built to a certain degree , then determine the name list of school libraries for donation .
why was n't there evidence of the donation ?
on the doubts of why people like yi zhongtian did not show evidence of their donations , xiao rong stressed that what they had with yu qiuyu was completely a " gentlemen 's agreement . "
" the completion of the libraries in september is the recepit , the evidence , and i always hoped everyone would be patient . "
huang yuhai , chairman of 99 read , said , " the books donated by teacher yu are ready ; as required by the local education committee , they will be delivered between 30 july and 15 august . "
the aba prefecture department of education : 770,000 in donations is still in special accounts .
regarding the specific amounts and uses of these donations from writers such as a lai , mai jia , and yang hongying , last night reporters interviewed hao shichang , director of the aba prefecture department of education , by phone .
director hao said , " we received a total of more than 774,000 yuan in dinations for the ' 5-12 post-disaster rural school rebuilding movement ' started by the three authors a lai , mai jia , and yang hongying . "
of this , the three authors donated 450,000 , and the rest of the donations were mainly given by authors from around china .
this money was originally donated to build baihua elementary in wenchuan county , but since the elementary schools in wenchuan county were all built by guangdong province , this money was left there for the moment , and placed in the special account of the aba prefecture bureau of finance as ' social donations for post-disaster rebuilding . '
director hao said that he was consulting with writers such as a lai over using this money to build elementary schools in other counties .
director hao said , " a lai has already been to aba prefecture three times to make proper arrangements for these donations . "
as for the final destination of this money , we will certainly give the public a definite answer when the time comes ; please trust the aba prefecture education fund and give the donating authors a clear name .
" if you do not believe me , you are welcome to come to aba prefecture to find me " ; reporter xiao mengping .
vote for one , there have been 1,070 votes .
1 . satisfied , it does n't matter what he donates as long as he donates ; 6.17 % ( 66 ) .
2 . not satisfied , why did he say at first he would donate 200,000 , was it they could not sell the books ; 12.90 % ( 138 ) .
3 . it does n't matter , i do n't care ; 1.12 % ( 12 ) .
english missing
5 . other , leave a message ; 0.47 % .
do n't gossip everyone , this is a time of crisis , when the money is there it cannot come out easily , they should just donate the books they cannot sell .
now i am very poor , and i have to use money for all the necessities of life .
i sell breakfast and i do n't know if it 's better to donate fried dough sticks or soy milk , can someone please give me a suggestion ?
yu qiuyu , do n't insist on saving face if you are so cheap , this is such a terrible thing to do , it really makes me uncomfortable !
he went back on his word , he should be ashamed to face that great beggar who donated !
at first he stated he would donate books himself , what 200,000 , we are not very advanced , we do n't know the difference between money and books .
you are an advanced teacher , an advanced intellectual , how can you say donating books is donating money , how can you not be responsible for what you say , you should be responsible for your words and actions .
ask yourself , are you still an advanced teacher in the academic world ; you are tricking all of society , people like you do n't know fame but know shame !
that 's how it is , who knows whether it was yu qiuyu who did it himself .
if it 's donating books so be it , it is also glorious , why lie , it 's shameless !
inhumane , all name and no substance , an embarrassment to the learned , he should be blacklisted .
looking at that appearance he is not someone who practices self-cultivation , or sinology ?
he wants fame , but is shameless .
the music hall girls want to donate , making bureau of education director xiao even happier !
teacher yu , did you donate the books you wrote yourself ; if so i look down upon you , are your books useful to middle school students ?
also a year ago why did n't you come out and refute the reports that said you donated books and not cash , and not long before there was a statement that said you donated royalties .
i am dull and do n't know whether the great teacher did something appropriate ; the great teacher is a great teacher and laymen like me who are perplexed are bewildered , you are really great .
there 's an old saying that heaven is watching what people do , and if you were really wronged you will be treated fairly , and if you were not wronged you will be repaid ; as a person you ca n't go against your conscience , is that undeserved reputation useful ?
you do n't hope that later sayings like " do n't be a person like yu qiuyu " will appear ; what do you say , when you are old you should reflect on yourself and your conscience .
what 's with the aba county department of education ?
everyone , do n't just curse people , now chinese authors are all broke , and donating books is dutiful ; also , books are expensive now , and 30,000 books cost much more than 200,000 .
this little yu blackened chinese culture .
it 's a shame to burn books they ca n't sell , instead of money they get fame and fortune from donation , they deserve to be called profiteers .
what are royalties , do they give the author royalties or an author 's fee ?
if it is tax , it should be given to the state tax authorities , it is the state 's money ; how could he donate the number ?
called a great teacher , but he really is a little man who went back on his word , i look down on him !
donating books is safe , it saves him from not knowing were the things he donated go in the end .
30,000 books , each book at 6.67 yuan ; mr. yu really knows how to calculate it , this year paper is cheap , if it was last year , he never would have donated books .
i think that mr. yu bought all of the books that each bookstore could not sell , look at the book prices ; they absolutely were worth 200,000 yuan , but if they were bought by the pound , that would only be 0.45 yuan .
yu qiuyu is not a fake gentleman , he is a genuine little person !
this guy who is always selling x , bullying us who do n't understand the significance of books and money .
xiao rong , deputy director of the bureau of education of dujiangyan city , and mr. yu " currently " have reached a " gentlemen 's agreement on donating books , " i understand that it was settled last year , right ?
because not long ago xiao rong , deputy director of the bureau of education of dujiangyan city , was suspected in a coverup .
he deserves to be called " great master yu , " he can even mix up donated money and books , that 's really too great , " a great master " is really " a great master " !
if they were n't named " qiuyu libraries , " i 'm afraid he would n't have donated ; if the library names are changed that is n't real charity ; businesspeople are quite clever !
donation is a good thing , but now it has become hype !
looking for fame , 30,000 books , three " qiuyu libraries , " this ad was very cheap .
i have these questions : 1 , was he " forced to donate " afterward ?
2 , does the bureau of education have witnesses ?
3 , i hear the process is very complicated , were the diplomas of the bureau of education workers bought ?
4 , if he only came out to clear it up after such a long time , does this mean he wants to gain " popularity " ?
everyone be more lenient , whether he donated money or books , he had the intention of donating .
and money can be spent on vital things , it is enough to let the children and students of the disaster area get the corresponding care , if you have time to spit in here , take some time to donate something .
this kind of result makes me uncomfortable , it is not good treatment .
any donations are of help to the disaster areas , they should all be praised ; i do n't think we should doubt him , what is to be donated is the concern of the person donating , there is no need for such dispute .
looking at how the entire thing unfolded , yu 's motive is apparent at first glance , it is not at all simple charity , but people are not as easily fooled as his readers ; there is no doubt he is smart , but there is the saying that " smart people make smart mistakes " ; " literary people lack moral character , " it is dispicable , detestable , shameful , and despisable .
did he make more donations after donating the books ? if you were not famous that would be the end , and nobody would find you if you told a lie ; you have to be more careful in the future , everyone will look at your every word and action , haha , there is also a price for fame .
the chinese people really need to check their character , donating books is pretty good , what have you all done ? do n't sit there denouncing others .
the result was that the readers gathered money and donated them in his name .
there 's no need to say that donating books is donating money .
at the time of donation he said it was money , then later it was books , i can also donate this , can books serve as money , that 's not bad , if they can be used , the whole world can donate books , and the famous people ? the country takes too good care of famous people .
how much do 30,000 books cost , what is the bulk price at the book store , we who want to buy books are very clear , are they worth 200,000 ? some hemp sack books are only worth a few dozen yuan .
i only make 20 some yuan after working a few times at the brick factory , if i knew this beforehand , i would have donated a few hundred red bricks .
i saw him for who he is in this incident , i do n't want to see him again , the sorrow for iris , who will be happy marrying this kind of man ?
great master yu is talented , one of his books is worth several yuan , there seems to be no space for bargaining .
i 'm not ok , if i think my own things are worth 3 or 5 mao , if i did n't donate the county seat then forget it , i am not a high-class animal .
yu qiuyu has changed .
he went from being a high-minded author to a money grubbing businessman .
someone once said to me " money can change a man . "
at the time i did n't believe it , but i do now .
he really fooled the people , tricking public opinion ! he has society in the palm of his hand ; whether it is donating books or moeny it does n't matter , anyway it is using a great disaster to gain fame .
yu qiuyu , do n't insist on saving face if you are so cheap , this is such a terrible thing to do , it really makes me uncomfortable !
if it 's donating books so be it , it is also glorious , why lie , it 's shameless ! a fake gentleman is also like this , who knows whether it was yu qiuyu 's own hype .
great master yu was a master at changing books into money , this has become donating a lot of money , and the money has changed back into books , really the way of a great master !
it is always good to contribute , do n't attack people being active in charity , you ca n't be too harsh .
shower , directed by zhang yang , is a good movie , and in it jiang wu plays the dumb son of a bath house manager .
in the end , the bath house that father and son had watched over their entire lives was to be torn down .
when he sees the demolition team coming to take away the furniture in the bath house , the dumb jiang wu tries to drive them out , and he takes the bath house 's high water pressure hose and wildly sprays the demolition team , using water to drive the demolition team out of the bath house .
the bath house in the movie was originally the hundred year-old bath house shuangxingtang in nanyuan , fengtai district , beijing city .
sometimes fictitious images correspond to reality and cause people to sigh .
in reality shuangxingtang , which faced decline in shower , also faced the predicament of iminent demolition .
according to media reports , the bath house owner was as anxious as ants on a hotplate , and wracked his brains , and finally came up with an ingenious plan : apply for heritage status .
without applying for heritage status it would not be protected .
common people who want to use their flesh to resist demolition are like throwing eggs against rocks , and if they ar enot careful , they will lose their lives .
if you want to try to arm wrestle with the demolition teams , it is like the path on mount hua , you can only offer an " official " banner .
then the owner made up his mind : apply for heritage status for the bath house .
if he did not apply for heritage status , very soon the bath house would only leave behind a corpse .
however , when applying for heritage status , especially after successfully applying , the situation is completely different .
after all , the government decides whether it has heritage status , and most demolition teams wo n't dare to be rash .
i believe that the owner of shuangxingtang was very smart , but he did not see through the problem .
the government decides whether you can apply for heritage status , and is n't it also the government 's decision of whether to demolish it ?
no , a cadre in fengtai district told the media that even if the old building successfully applied for heritage status , whether shuangxingtang could avoid demolition is still an unknown factor .
listening to this makes one rather nervous .
whether to tear it down is no longer a problem in today 's china .
the problem is that after such an ordinary bath house as shuangxingtang is torn down , where will the people go to take a bath ?
wash at home ? this is too big of a difference .
washing alone at home is called individual enjoyment and bathing at a bath house is group enjoyment , could they be the same ?
it is as the old men who bathe every day in the clear pool in shower say when they learn that the bath house is to be demolished .
" how is one person taking a shower using a water heater as comfortable as soaking here ? "
" everyone talks and laughs together at the bath house , it is very exciting ; it 's all over . "
" it 's all over " does not mean the bath house , but the people 's customs .
what is demolished is not a bath house , but a period of history .
after the bath house was demolished , a commercial bathing center was built on the location ; who could afford it ?
certainly not those retired people who frequented the bath house and got less than 2,000 yuan per month .
the bath house should belong to all of the people , in particular the lower-level masses , this is common sense .
it plays the same role as chengdu teahouses , paris cafes , and london pubs ; it is not expensive and is beneficial .
most importantly , it plays the role of a public space for society .
family , friends , and neighbors can always find a place to hang out and chat about the times or family .
but this place must be comfortable and free and be affordable by ordinary people .
have n't bath houses played the role of " public talking places " for so many years ?
they have played this role very well , why now must there be change ?
one standard answer is that bath houses are backward , unsanitary , affect the city 's appearance , and have very low profit rates , so it would be better to tear them down to rebuild bathing centers that bring more returns .
but these grandiose words clearly evade basic common sense .
that is , the customers of the bath houses have the right to answer the question of whether they are backward , profitable , and need removing , and not the politicians getting massages at the bathing centers .
they just want a " public space " that belongs to them , a tradition , a custom , a favorite place .
no matter what you say , it can all be summed up in one line called human nature .
i was chatting with a friend who studied abroad in japan , and we discussed their nervous test preparations , and only then did i learn that some students reviewed for the exams in the japanese " sentos " ( public bath houses ) .
when i first heard that i could not imagine it , but think about it .
self-service " sentos " are low-cost and have quiet environments , and the bathing times are basically not limited , so anyone , including even poor students , can afford them .
it really is like being at home , and the best place for preparing for the exams .
in this way , japanese students choosing to review their study materials in bath houses does not seem strange .
but in our country this probably would n't happen .
you can argue all you want , but the logic behind tearing down the bath houses is that only the officials are allowed to bathe , not the masses .
from now on , in the capital only officials and the wealthy who drop more than 1,000 yuan on a bath are seen , and poor urban residents like us can only stay in our own free showers at home .
to see the leaders in the bath houses is harder than the herd boy seeing the weaving girl .
in this way each goes its separate way and society is more stable and harmonious .
is n't it just a bath house ; tear it down if you have to , then build a new one somewhere else .
nostalgia .
since i was little i took free showers , i do n't think there 's anything bad about it .
in the group discussion meetings at the cppcc , zhang wenkang , executive member of the cppcc and former minister of the ministry of health , said that even though every year the government work reports mention problems with fighting corruption and advocating clean government , there has been no clear improvement for several years , and ideological ethics building is weak .
he gave the example of a child who said that when she grew up she " wanted to be a corrupt official , " because corrupt officials make a lot of money , and this phenomenon is very scary ( 14 march jinghua times ) .
zhang wenkang 's example did not come out of nowhere , and it really did happen .
in september 2009 , a young girl who had just started elementary school was asked what she wanted to be when she grew up , and she very earnestly said that she wanted to be an official , a corrupt official , when she grew up , " because corrupt officials have a lot of things . "
we must admit that there really is more than just one kid who has the idea of " becoming an official " or " becoming a corrupt official " after they grow up .
moreover , elementary schools in places like changsha and chengdu have had projects such as " young government " and " little land of plenty " so that students can fulfill their " desires to be officials . "
children are like this , not to mention adults .
actualy to put " want to be an official " another way , such as " want to be a leader , " this is even more common .
a recent survey by china youth daily shows that nearly 70 % of the young respondents said they wanted to be leaders .
clearly , whether it is a child who wants to be a corrupt official , or an adult who wants to be a leader , the reason is , to use the simple words of the child , " they have a lot of things . "
these " good things " are nothing more than power , fame , status , and respect .
children are naive and good , their souls are blank sheets of paper .
but why do they have this worldly " ideal " ; who polluted this " blank sheet " so badly ?
clearly , children wanting to be corrupt officials is not like the young prime minister li si being " woken up " by the fat rats in the grain storehouse to the fact that people are like the storehouse rats , but is the result of dual material and spiritual pollution in the entire social environment .
while parents and teachers teach children to be honest and upright , the children see and hear a different reality .
for example schools put on fake appearances when there are inspections from higher-ups .
at new year 's , parents gladly accept money given by others .
in tv shows evildoers use underhanded means to beat good people .
the media reports how luxuriously certain corrupt officials live , but they are n't correspondingly punished , and we hear the people around us complaining again , and so on .
it is what kids see and hear in their everyday lives that gives them this kind of feeling .
it is not only very easy to be a corrupt official , corrupt officials also get many " good things , " and are not punished .
in the eyes of some children , there is nothing more impressive than being an official or even a high official , and even those corrupt officials become " heroes " or " successful people " in the eyes of the children .
from this it is not difficult to understand why children think it is their life " ideal " to be officials and even corrupt officials .
it is apparent that the root of children wanting to be corrupt officials or the " no clear improvement in fighting corruption and advocating clean government " that zhang wenkang mentioned is in the very low risk and cost of being a corrupt official , even to the point of being zero .
the reason is that on the one hand , officials are not restrained , and there is a lack of corresponding balancing mechanism on power ; even though there are some supervisory mechanisms , they are often have no voice or are mere formalities .
on the other hand , the power of the organization department to punish corrupt officials is excessively light -- " seeking accountability " of officials often stops at the level of " house rules , " and the application of " national laws " is rarely seen .
even though there are " house rules , " they are mostly administrative punishments of no consequences such as " removed from post " or " dismissed from post . "
from this it is not hard to see that the methods for ending the deformed " corrupt official dream " of the children and improving the results of fighting corruption and advocating clean government are very clear .
but it is regrettable that zhang wenkang believes that it is caused by a shortage of ideological ethics building .
ethical instruction does have an effect , but its effect is miniscule .
the method that is more convincing and has a more direct effect than education is in perfecting the relevant supervisory mechanisms , increasing the strength of punishments for corrupt officials , and fully exposing punished officials in the media .
we can only eliminate these incorrect ideas if we utterly discredit and wipe out the assets of corrupt officials and let children see more corrupt officials getting what is coming to them .
national prosperity must take the path of scientific and technical development .
in 2009 , wan gang , minister of the ministry of science and technology , published an article in science and technology daily entitled " innovate , drive science development , write new chapter in national rejuvenation . "
in this article , he summarized the 60 years since the founding of new china , the series of magnificent achievements in china 's &amp; causes , and the major contributions of &amp; toward promoting modern construction , improving people 's lives , and maintaining national security .
minister wan discussed four aspects of the relationship between innovation and national prosperity .
he views innovation as the inherent driver of chinese civilization that has not let up for 5,000 years ; he points out that the 60 years of development of new china laid a solid foundation for the country 's prosperity , believes that the drive of innovation is a necessary requirement for realizing &amp; development , and advocates planning innovative development paths and realizing the grand rejuvenation of the chinese people .
on the subject of planning innovative development paths and realizing the grand rejuvenation of the chinese people , he further says we must do good work in six key aspects .
1 . take the ability for self-innovation as the strategic base point for &amp; development ;
2 . strengthen fundamental research and leading technology research , and improve the ability of &amp; exploration and innovation ;
3 . further unite &amp; and the economy and make full use of the supporting and leading role of &amp; in the economy and society ;
4 . deepen system and mechanism reform , build a national innovation system with chinese characteristics ;
5 . cultivate and create a large high-quality talent team for supporting innovative development , mobilize and make use of people 's enthusiasm , proactive natures , and creativity to the greatest extent ;
6 . establish open cooperation , incorporate different concepts , and make full use of both domestic and international resources .
as he is the minister of the ministry of &amp; , this article of wan gang 's can be seen as an outline of china 's &amp; world , and an important itegral part of the central party authorities ' strategy to rejuvenate the country through &amp; .
the content of this article is comprehensive and has deep meaning , and i very much approve of it .
however , speaking realistically , this paper only looks at the achivements of the &amp; world from the front .
that is , everything this article describes is the good aspect of things , and not one word mentions the problems existing in china 's &amp; world .
reporting the good news , but not the bad is an unwritten rule of chinese officials , and i fully understand the situation minister wan is in .
also , the subject of his article advocates the relationship between &amp; innovation and national prosperity , so it is reasonable and i cannot criticize him for not mentioning the problems that currently exist in china 's &amp; world .
to me , china 's achievements in the &amp; world are clear , but the problems that exist are extremely severe .
of course we want to recognize the magnificent achievements that have been made , but we also cannot overlook serious existing problems .
this is because the existing problems will negatively impact coming &amp; development and be impediments on the road to &amp; development .
not eliminating these impediments will have a huge impact on the speed and efficiency of &amp; development .
here i will help minister wan summarize some of the major problems that currently exist in china 's &amp; world .
in august 2010 , nearly one year after minister wan 's article was published , three reporters from the people 's daily , zhao yahui , zhao yongxin , and yu jianbin , interviewed four well-known figures in china 's &amp; world , wang zhizhen , rao yi , shi yigong , and mei yonghong , on systemic reforms and existing problems for chinese &amp; .
wang zhizhen is an academician at the chinese academy of sciences , and an experienced researcher at the cas institute of biophysics .
rao yi is director and a professor of the peking university school of life sciences .
shi yigong is director and a professor of the tsinghua university school of life sciences .
mei yonghong is director of the ministry of &amp; policy rules and systemic reform office .
the views of these four more or less represent the views of most &amp; workers in china , and are a reasonable and fair summary of the problems that currently exist in china 's &amp; world .
therefore , i will use their views to explain these problems .
they discuss many aspects , but all return to two main problems .
one is policy system problems .
they believe that there is corruption such as collusion between officials and academics , standards of official ranks , power for hire , and excessive administrative interference in the current policy system .
in this system , &amp; personnel lack independence and many major projects lack coordinated overlapping management , causing policies to come up against one another , low-level repetition of projects , and a severe waste of resources .
second , there is a serious issue with some &amp; personnel having poor individual character , rushing to make immediate profit , and failing to use proper academic standards .
there are many chinese &amp; papers , but they are not cited very often and are not of high quality .
not long ago there was a dispute over whether the problems in china 's &amp; world were systemic or in the character of &amp; personnel .
according to sciencenet data , most people believe it is systemic , and a minority believe it is in individual character .
i believe that it is a result of both working together .
the reason is very simple : if the system were very fair and reasonable , then there would be no room for those &amp; personnel of poor character and the &amp; world would continue existing .
conversely , if the vast majority of &amp; personnel have good character , then on the basis of this group , there would be nowhere for a bad system to stand , and it very quickly would be eliminated .
therefore , clearly , the problem with china 's current &amp; world is both in abuse of the system and in problems with the poor character of &amp; personnel .
to effectively resolve the problems existing in the &amp; world , we must on the one hand undertake deep systemic reforms , and also must work hard to improve the individual character of &amp; personnel .
no matter what , &amp; development represents the overall strength of a country and is the basic driving force for national rejuvenation .
deng xiaoping once said that &amp; is the first production force .
that 's right , &amp; is the overall competitiveness of a country ; in this era of globalization , international competition is increasingly fierce .
taking the path of &amp; development and improving the quality of &amp; is the only path to increasing competitiveness , and is the fundamental assurance of a country standing up among the forest of world nations .
your intelligence is basically level with our current level of &amp; ; it is already way ahead of our country 's &amp; management !
cppcc member cui yongyuan used the example of the annual cell phone fee of usd 9.9 in los angeles , u.s. in group discussions to attack chinese cell phone fees as being " unreasonably expensive . "
after that , many netizens wrote posts saying that little cui 's data was inaccurate .
upon verification , little cui immediately apologized on a microblog and admitted to mistakenly using the data .
a reporter interviewed cui yongyuan , and he sincerely apologized for his own " irresponsible talk , " but said that he was not trying to gain attention with outlandish statements .
he insisted that he used the latest data that can prove that american phone fees are much cheaper than those in china .
any discerning person could immediately see that cui yongyuan 's opinion was aimed at the problem of whether fees collected by the monopolized industry are reasonable .
as for whether the reference system he chose is reasonable and whether the data he quoted is accurate , it is enough to say that it can show his " viewpoint . "
his objective is extremely clear ; in his own words , " actually i am very tolerant , and if you have a reasonable reason you can tell us why phone calls in china are so expensive , then i will accept it . "
clearly , as long as the telecommunication authorities have an authoritative explanation that gives a reason for the fees , cui yongyuan and even all phone consumers will have to accept the reason and wo n't intentionally cause trouble .
actually , china has hundreds of millions of cell phone users , and who does not pay their fees at the prices set by the telecommunication authorities and is able to negotiate their own price ?
furthermore , cell phone fees are very difficult for users to grasp , and you cannot figure out the frequently changing names of service items and fees .
and if you are not careful , they will " tailor make " a certain additional service fee .
even if you want to , you cannot avoid the junk services the operators provide to you .
anyway , cui yongyuan is a cppcc member , and expressing his own views at meetings about state matters is an expression of him performing his duties .
you cannot require that he speak the truth in every sentence , this is basic common sense .
it is worth showing respect that cui yongyuan said , " i apologize for not being careful , but this will not affect the straightforwardness of my words in the future . "
the masses admittedly hope that their delegates make fewer mistakes in their speeches , but they also want " frank words " ; this undoubtedly shows the assumption of responsibility .
the people would be blessed if there were more such cppcc members who dared to speak the truth and who had the ability and skill to speak the truth .
no wonder that this made netizens envious and jealous : " everyone knows that public servants have good benefits , but i have never experienced it so directly as i did today . "
according to what our textbooks taught us when we were young , i suspect that municipal-level public servants in nanjing have already made it to the ideal life of the communist society .
phenomena like this government cafeteria with " one yuan meals " have long been prevalent in many government authorities , and become " unwritten rules " of government subsidies .
he also swore in all seriousness that he " absolutely did not " enjoy meal subsidies , and that everyone brought money to the cafeteria to refill their meal cards and that the cafeteria was " non-profit . "
this is a hidden benefit and subsidy , and is fundamentally no different from eating and drinking on the public dime .
the blue paper also points out that for the first time professional status has become the main factor affecting the lives of rural residents , and workers and peasants have basically been thrown out , and public servants have become the first choice of profession for urban and rural residents .
all of the answers can be found on this menu from the nanjing municipal-level authority cafeterias .
this kind of society is just like a cripple , it is in danger of falling over at any time !
the rich have good wine and food .
actually , these few examples reported by the media are just the tip of the iceberg ; phenomena similar to this government cafeteria having " one yuan meals " have long been prevalent in many government units , and have become " unwritten rules " of government subsidies .
no different than feeling uncomfortable after dying .
these are public servants of the people ?
ah , these public servants eat and drink well , i am just afraid that with too much nourishment they will bully the people !
i hope that the service would match the benefits .
we should understand that this is just one part of corruption .
the china people 's livelihood index subject group led by vice director wu xiaoling of the financial and economic committee of the national people 's congress ,
last year completed the " 2010 chinese city residents happiness survey , "
75 percent of those interviewed felt happy .
and after analyzing the industries and professions those surveyed were in it was discovered that ,
the proportion of principals of state entities and party organizations , enterprises and institutions answering " extremely happy " was highest .
( february 18 , people 's net )
the happiness survey is only a perception survey ,
or it can be said to be an approximate number survey ,
and not every item has a specific index .
however , " state entities and party organizations " is actually an ostensive group .
with wu xiaoling 's professional background as the former vice bank president of the central bank , paying attention to the analysis of data is of course necessary .
add to this that the subject group he lead was also a comparatively independent survey entity ,
therefore , the survey results concerning the sense of happiness of " state entities and party organizations " is believable overall .
this conclusion is quite suitable to narrating general techniques :
outside of expectations but within reason .
those that work in " state entities and party organizations " are civil servants , and are also the people 's public servants that we often talk of .
in our impression they are the group of people with the greatest pressure , and the matters and responsibilities they bear far exceed that of civil servants of developed nations ,
yet this does not affect the intense arrival of a sense of " extreme happiness " in the least .
of course , according to the principle of social living of going after profits and avoiding disadvantages ,
the yearly " national exams " with people failing in droves , has long ago magnificently passed a verdict on the " sense of happiness " of this group .
there is little ground for criticism for civil servants feeling happy .
if civil servant feel happy , then everybody is happy .
looking from the political pursuit and value direction of " serving the people , "
public servants are those who are backing the people ,
to change to a slogan we are familiar with , they are those who " take bitterness first for enjoyment later , "
if this explanation still holds at present , the " extreme sense of happiness " of civil servants came " very positively . "
because in the survey , those with the lowest proportion of answering " extremely happy " were production and transportation equipment operators and agricultural , forestry , husbandry , fishing and aquatic goods production personnel .
what are " production and transportation equipment operators and agricultural , forestry , husbandry , fishing and aquatic goods production personnel ? "
they are the " workers and farmers " we are familiar with , called the " hard working masses " during the revolutionary years .
this huge group were the creators of society 's wealth , and are those for whom the livelihood of civil servants depends , they are the masters .
may i ask : where in the world is there such a thing where " masters " do n't feel happy while " servants " feel " extremely happy ? "
of course civil servants should have a sense of happiness ,
however , the sense of happiness of civil servants should come first from whether their performance has left people satisfied or not .
premier wen jiabao has emphasized multiple times :
" our government is the people 's government ,
our power is bestowed by the people ,
we should seek benefits for the people and conscientiously accept the supervision of the people .
whether the masses are satisfied or not , happy or not , consenting or not is the only standard in weighing the quality of government work .
" and now , workers and farmers feel " extremely unhappy " ,
how could they be satisfied ? happy ? consenting ?
thus , the " extreme happiness " of civil servants is actually rude , and leaves workers and farmers astonished .
the reason that civil servants feel " extremely happy " is very clear with everybody .
although their wages are not high , yet they will never see lack of salaries occur ;
and although housing prices are very expensive , yet " relevant departments " will always allow you to live in an apartment the general person would n't be able to live in ;
and although their power is subject to " supervision and restraints , "
however , if they are careful and meticulous , and do things appropriately , there will always be endless numbers of " marginal effects "
( there are also people who call this " rent seeking " ,
the official explanation is : ultimately it 's a minority ) .
this is of course not strange ,
those before have said : " all those with power have tendencies towards abusing their power to seek personal gains . "
the question is if we can correctly view the perversion of the " power bestowed by the people . "
can we reset the positions of " master and servant " from the system level , and not allow them to be turned upside down .
i am almost 50 years old and had china construction bank furlough me ,
now i have no income and no job ,
i am not happy at all ,
today many people who do nothing good are especially happy
a media company of guangzhou city hired a retired female cadre as a consultant ,
before this female cadre retired she always held important positions in the media , her work capabilities were strong , and she reached retirement age these past two years .
because her children have already begun working , and she has no family burdens , she could entirely continue to work ,
however , because of age limits , the media entity she is with can only allow her to continue to work through the method of rehiring .
as to this , many female coworkers of that entity privately discussed this , believing that this was caused by concepts of men and women being unequal .
they believe that , with the progress of society , the lives of men and women are both getting longer , and how to define tolerance for female physiology is not important , however , the average age of females retiring is 5-10 years earlier than males ,
this is absolutely not advantageous to women fully participating in economic construction and social development , and also cannot fully embody the fair principle of equality between men and women .
lu liang , serving in the human resource department at a large scale production enterprise of guangzhou , said frankly that : " the family burden of older female employees is smaller , their children are also older , and those matters they 've needed to arrange have been arranged , and they actually would more like to work diligently than young women . "
she brought up a helpless example , one of her female friends is a financial affairs general supervisor of a large enterprise , 55 years old this year , and although she is skilled , because of age limits , she has to retire .
before she retired , there was a internal rumor in the company , saying a 57 year old male from a subsidiary company under the group would come and take over for her .
she believed that under the situation of having the same ages for school and employment , with the same physical conditions , and the same capabilities , and assuming the same societal responsibilities and family obligations between men and women , working time being cut back 5 years means economic income and self worth " shrinks . "
she calculated some numbers for the reporter : a professional woman with a undergraduate degree is already nearing 25 years old when coming to her work post , and when retiring at 55 , the time she has served society is only 30 years ;
the physical condition of some females is excellent , and work experience rich , however , because of retirement age restrictions , they can only say goodbye to their work positions , this is a kind of loss to professional women and society as a whole .
you 're right , you 're still very young at 50 plus , retiring so early is a kind of waste !
in reality , the majority of females who quietly retire late are civil servant officials below the department level and above the county office level ,
institution cadres , regular female civil servants , low level cadres do n't even think about retiring late .
a small part of female university professors and female experts in professional skill areas do indeed want to do some things , but also do n't want to retire late , because they can likely be rehired or hired by other departments that give even higher compensation .
the great majority of female workers do n't even want to retire late , and just want to retire early . thus , female civil servants , female cadres cannot retire late , female technology workers can consider the situation , female workers can flexibly retire .
retire , why retire , i want to hoard a little more . i am not tired going to work . this is really outrageous , nowadays consumer prices are so high , if i retire , who will give me presents ?
the setting of retirement age limits must consider the state of the nation , retirement age limits should have age boundaries set , 50-60 years for example , with willingness and political accomplishments united , being advantageous to societal development ,
( the old farts of the development and reform commission should retire earlier )
writer : talent jungle
after approximately 40 minutes , the police took him away from his apartment
the reporter learned from the danfeng county discipline inspection committee that the discipline inspection committee was still reviewing the results of dealing with that certain fang at the moment . "
the same illegal behavior , but different statuses produce different punishments , this indubitably proves -- ' everybody is equal in front of the law ' is absolutely a ancient myth .
that certain fang was a chairman of the chairman group from zigu county to the national people 's congress , he was an elder with honors , and if he molested women at most he 'd just be warned , and nothing would happen .
you cannot say too much , because our internet is very free , so free there are too many sensitive words , and you can only click to them !
that certain fang forcibly hugged and groped , if it was n't that the husband of the female boss did not timely stop him , the weak would have been hard pressed to avoid being ravaged .
the common people are equal towards common people , officials are equal towards officials , you have to understand the significance of this sentence
administrative and inter-party punishment , the protective effect is excessively strong .
so what that you can ? just hit the floor !!!
administrative and inter-party punishment , the protective effect is excessively strong
is n't this just a special power matter
since ancient times the people have not fought with officials , if you are a official you have a umbrella of protection above your head .
if it were regular people or the common people , he would have definitely been given a crime and sentenced .
the county and town heads now are local emperors .
ugh , endure it , if you do n't have money and do n't have power just endure it .
this was absolutely not likely the first transgression , if you just investigate , maybe there would be material ..... .
the persons involved should bring a law suit , this would also be good will supervision of the government .
i approve with both hands , these are the characteristics that china 's officials have given us common people : eat .... having all kinds of money ..... . . actions ..... . . free ..... . !!!!
having everything equal in front of the law , can this truly be done ?
totally shameless , shit it out and feed dogs .
secretary \ county heads \ they are the same quality as directors
these kind of people should have their party memberships cancelled !! treat them severely !!!!
the reason the civil servant exam is so popular
if you get it right they 'll give you several years .
officials have protection masks !
china 's laws are deceiving the common people .
county and town heads , town secretaries , they are local emperors , the mountains are high and the emperor far away , many base level leaders and cadres eat and drink all day , flattering the leaders above them , and bullying the common people below them , practicing deception , the majority of common people are angry but dare not say anything .
being an official is really great , i 'd also like to be one , if people help me , i 'll give them a million
if you want equality , then you come and create it yourself
not involving yourself in current affairs is best , saying it over a thousand or ten thousand times cannot change anything , is it that nobody can see this ?
china 's tragedy
sweat ! sweat ! sweat !
paying attention to this is more important than the matter itself !
furthermore , it is within china 's current characteristics .
this has already progressed , before this was called corrupting revolutionary cadres , so we should welcome this method of punishment that has already progressed
if they do not severely punish this guy , then it 's not equality between officials and the people , now the law enforcing agencies have lost all of the face of the communist party
what equality for everybody , that is the words of those bird officials !
that guy should be dragged out and beaten to a pulp , and then shut up for half a year
this is called chinese characteristics
officials , molesting women , this is understandable , they are higher than the common people , everybody is equal , but in the law , the officials receive the protection of the law !
in front of the law everybody is equal , but our generation will likely not witness this
he should be attacked severely , and the matter handled according to the law .....
i do n't know what is called fairness !
otherwise , would everybody fight to be an official ?
those who are officials mutually protect yourselves and wait
get used to it , society is very realistic !
nowadays officials and thieves are very brazen , and there is nothing they dare not do , first skimming , then buying , and then going ; if they have nothing to do they molest women .
the regular citizens and common people just chatter a bit , those who are secretaries , town heads , chairmen , the law does not control them
if you cannot seek the fairness of the law , then use the sword in your hand to win respect and righteousness for yourself
if there are appeals , there is hope
do n't hate others , hate that you are not a civil servant !!
zheng fengtian : changing " stay at home children " to " following along children " is the best weapon for resolving the drought of migrant laborers
recently , to attract migrant laborers , various places have brought out new tricks ,
the governments in the west where they flow out from are using " stay home for the feelings of your family , "
and besides increasing wages , the eastern areas
are also using " big buses " and other weapons to welcome migrant laborers back to the cities .
these methods are of course very important ,
however , the most important one of them has been ignored ,
that is , we should ask what is most important for the migrant laborers .
looking overall , the amount of village labor of china has not actually greatly declined ,
so why is the drought in labor becoming worse and worse ?
there definitely are some people that stay in the villages and are unwilling to come out again to work ,
from what we hear the number has already reached 12 to 20 million .
a recent report talked about the core of the problem ,
that is " investigations discovered the problem of stay at home children lead to a great number of village workers not willing to go out "
( february 16 , 2011 " guangzhou daily " ) .
currently , the new generation of village workers were all born after 80 or 90 ,
the great majority of china 's villages have the custom of marrying early and having children early ,
those who are fathers and mothers around 20 years old are not in the minority ,
not marrying after 25 years old is considered an old aged youth , and it 's difficult to find a women , or the woman is too old .
last year a " 29 year old young mother ' rode a bike for a thousand kilometers ' to return home to see her son , " this moved countless people .
this mother used her own helpless " sad " actions to tell everybody :
only children are most important in the hearts of migrant workers .
if those employing entities and local governments can resolve this largest core problem of village workers ,
and change " stay at home children " to " following along children , "
allowing stay at home children the opportunity to follow their parents to the location of the work and receive education ,
i think those parents that stay in their villages would work hard and also go out to work ,
because of the superior quality education of the coastal cities is several times stronger than the villages ,
and to chinese parents , the education of their children is what they place the most importance on ,
and is also the sharpest weapon to attract them to go out to work .
if this is indeed done , not only will it greatly mitigate the severe labor drought problem china faces every year ,
but also in a few decades the nation will also harvest several tens of millions of outstanding talent that has received excellent education .
last year in november i attended the two day village worker round table conference held by the development research center of the state council ,
where this conference was different from the general research meeting was in that it invited many village worker representatives to attend .
at the conference one discovery was that what village workers are really concerned about was not the household registration and social insurance questions that we had imagined .
what was ranked first ?
the great majority of village workers choose " whether our children could go to school where i work . "
in their view , resolving the household registration issue is too complicated , and they did n't place their hopes on it .
social insurance issues is a matter for many years later , and they could n't wait that long .
the most urgent and issue of most concern for village workers at the present is the need to resolve " the question of education for our children , "
all other things could be pushed back .
" the pain of staying home " is the greatest pain in the hearts of many workers ,
they say : if we do n't return to be with our children , our children will be a waste in the future .
how many stay at home children does china have ?
58 million according to survey data of the national women 's federation ,
of which village stay at home children under the age of 14 are approximately 40 million .
because at present the great majority of regions in china have not resolved the problem of the children of migrant laborers entering school ,
to many stay at home children , papa and mama are only voices over the phone ,
long term lack of family emotions , poor looking after , the problems of stay at home children have already garnered the most concern for migrant laborers .
more frightening is , because of the distances , for many stay at home children it is even hard to see their parents even once every several years .
as stay at home children do not receive the care of their parents for long periods , they have psychological issues ,
many children have become problematic youth .
recently , of the criminals in the new generation of village workers , the great majority were stay at home children back then .
this is a societal problem that must be viewed properly .
to resolve the drought in migrant workers , many places have brought out " keeping people with wages , keeping people with feelings , keeping people with careers , keeping people with cities , "
this is all good .
but most importantly they should be using " children " to keep people .
what child is not dear to their parent ?
village workers who do n't marry or do n't have children are very few , and basically all are married and have children .
working away from home for years or months , after the economic situation of the family improves ,
whether the children can obtain excellent education or not becomes the issue they are most concerned with .
in reality , some open methods form abroad are worthy of china 's study .
in recent years i 've discovered a new phenomenon ,
that is , no matter how busy my coworkers are , they will put down their busy jobs in china , and take their children to america to study for a year or half a year .
according to what they say , recharging themselves is actually a secondary concern , letting the children receive education in america is their main purpose .
according to china 's reasoning , these chinese who go abroad to study are not americans at all ,
and their children do not have the qualifications to study in america .
in reality , that 's wrong , america has a very " generous " legal regulation ,
that is , any child living in america has the right to receive 12 years of compulsory education ,
this kind of regulation not only ensures that the children going to study abroad in america of my colleagues can receive compulsory education in america ,
but also that the children of those illegal immigrants in america can go to school for free in america 's elementary and high schools just the same ,
every year america has as many as 65,000 children of illegal immigrants graduate from high school .
according to the different state of america , many immigrants can enjoy certain social benefits .
america 's elementary and high schools will not refuse to accept children into school because the child 's household registration does n't show him as a local or as an american , only this is the most far sighted .
the reason is very simple , children are the hope of the future , providing them with compulsory education when they are young ,
after they grow up , then they get superior human resources and citizens that respect the law .
in reality , allowing stay at home children to accompany their parents working in the cities to go to school there ,
as for the local children , it is also a very good encouragement .
presently , many children in the cities are little emperors , and do n't have sufficient motivation to study ,
if there are several children of migrant laborers in their class , i believe this will also be a kind of education for these city children .
besides this , at present the aging of china is coming soon , the idleness of resources for compulsory education in many cities is severe ,
take them out and use them for the children of migrant workers , this is actually fostering human resources for the future of the city .
because a great deal of china 's compulsory education is paid for by local governments ,
the state should come out with relevant legal and encouragement methods on the macroscopic level ,
such as issuing a certain amount of compulsory education costs for those locations receiving children of migrant workers according to however many they receive .
the future of the nation is in education ,
if , to resolve the " drought of migrant laborers , " we also resolve the problem of 58 million stay at home children getting education while accompanying their parents along the way ,
then that would be a " multiple win " choice that is beneficial to the state and the people .
( author zheng fengtian is a professor of renmin university of china )
children are everything
policies have caused the economic development of various places to be uneven , thus we have an army of floating population .
in resolving the future problems of the floating population army , what we must first resolve is the problem of the second generation of village workers
( to tell the truth , i really like big brother jackie chan 's movies . however , big brother 's performance this time was very hard for me to understand . )
when the citizens where agitated into losing their heads , big brother jackie chan was obviously the only one clearheaded .
from this bit of rare clarity , he allowed people to see there was quality with him , and it seemed that this was not the first time that this quality of his had been shown .
at every most crucial moment , when citizens were losing their way and did n't know the direction of the revolution , big brother could always stand up to show the right path to the people .
this is a kind of wisdom , and moreover was a blessing for the people .
with this wisdom of big brother 's the people needed not worry about being scared or confused and unsafe again .
even when facing the points of guns of ruffians , the people need not have the least bit of fear , because under the inspiration of the jackie chan spirit , the bullets of bandits where no more than balls .
the wisdom of big brother jackie chan is valued by everybody , and its exactly this that displays the foolishness of the people .
big brother from beginning to end has believed in the fate that " the chinese have to be disciplined , otherwise they will have desires , " that is a worry coming from the stupidity of the people .
looking from the view of big brother jackie chan , citizens can absolutely not be not controlled .
for example those tourists held hostage , if they just simply stayed in hong kong to work and study and fight with capitalists , how would they have been killed by the filipinos ?
this is the evil consequence of careless freedom without discipline .
if you carefully consider it , if this group of hong kongers can conscientiously and willingly obey discipline as normal , and not say it is militarized management , even if they go to prison to accept management at their own initiative , there is no need to lack quality such as this .
where does excellent quality embody itself ?
first of all , its embodied in no fear in the face of danger .
if tourists could have a little bit of military quality , how would they have been killed by a little filipino policeman ?
excellent quality is also embodied in the attitude taken after a crisis occurs .
those with excellent discipline , as soon as they see danger or even dying people , they will first look for causes with themselves , and devoting oneself to condemning the police or even hating the filipino government is a move that shows no education .
is it actually that the filipino government and police want to have dead people ? this was the wise expression of big brother jackie chan .
from this it can be seen that big brother jackie chan 's wisdom is extremely important to improving the quality of everybody .
strengthening management of the people is not only advantageous to resolving hostage crisis , but moreover is advantageous to handling all types of disasters in the future .
besides this , from big brother jackie chan , people can also see many brilliant humanistic qualities .
people cannot live again after dying , then just have them die and that 's it .
however , as to the living , even if you kill the murderer of people , you have to bestow leniency and love .
this is the true significance of the boundless love talked of in legend .
from this people can conjecture that , if there was a person called " jaycee chan " among those eight persons , big brother jackie chan would necessarily have posted a sign of emotion on his microblog as below like before :
" hong kong is a pluralistic ethic society , do n't worry , we are not hateful .
if the police shot to death the abductor as soon as it began , we would say : ' why did n't you not negotiate first ? '
however , if the police first negotiate , people would then ask : ' why did n't you not kill this abductor earlier ? ' "
hate causes people to be crazy , hate breeds evil .
big brother jackie chan is currently using his own words and actions and wisdom to educate the citizens that have lost their way and need discipline .
this just happens to be the embodiment of his spirit of universal love .
and although big brother is respected as big brother , yet making it in the jungle has the rules of the jungle .
those who try to make it in the jungle all know , if you go out , you will return sooner or later .
in these days of the nation being distressed , who knows if big brother jackie chan , besides just playing at his micro blog and letting the people study his wisdom , if he will occasionally remember this rule .
giving you an example , chinese study abroad students using drugs or degenerating , should this be happening ?
is it that foreigners should also consider we in china all use drugs and are degenerates ?
those filipino police committed a serious mistake , to say it more strictly , their actions represented the style of their nation .... however , can they represent the people of their entire nation ?
back then there was an american military delegation that visited china , the original aim was probably that our military invited them to carry out technical level exchanges in military areas .
however , as soon as the american side sat down , an official of the chinese side arrogantly pointed at the american representative and asked : " you tell me , is your fighting iraq for the oil or not ? "
the american military expert was dumbfounded to start with , but then laughingly said : " yes , that 's right . "
immediately , that chinese high level military official was overly pleased with himself , and leaned his body back , his eyes looking to the sky , expressing a likeness of winning a total victory and being very pleased .
everyone , hearing this story , do you think that it was the american military delegation that lost face , and lost face in a major way .
or is it the opposite ? that some other people lost some other thing ?
i truly do not know why people with such a low intelligence quotient , military quotient , political quotient as well as emotional quotient can become officials .
because officials , besides having all the outstanding qualities of a high level general-leader of a modernized military , should also have the air of a scholar .
as to this , i am worried about this kind of character .
is it useful to curse people
it is better to look at ourselves more
a giant in words , a dwarf in actions
after cursing them immediately immigrate , we are no strangers to this
dirty people always are interposing their talk with curses , and those cursed are not only patriots but also can save the nation , and most importantly is that they can prove their own greatness
cursing a bit does n't make you stubborn , this does not concern patriotism . those who are always cursing have hearts concealing malice , and must be protected against .
the poster is talking nonsense !
it should be that cursing america is a very dangerous matter .
coal power will use five dimes to bury you . will use those brain washed to knock you out ..... .
methods are always used to their extremes .
member of the standing committee of the national people 's congress , and institute head of the population and labor economy research institute of the chinese academy of social sciences cai fang expressed that at present , the gap between the starting salaries of china 's college graduates and the wages of peasant workers is gradually shrinking .
although he emphasized saying that the rate of salary modifications in the following years for college graduates was far higher than peasant workers , however , the current state of affairs will still likely cause a kind of negative incentive effect .
the same as in the past , every similar discussion will garner attention as to going to college being useless by many people .
to tell you the truth , the significance of the writer focusing on the workerilization of college graduate wages is not that great .
there are many reasons here , for example after expanding recruitment the numbers of college students have markedly increased , under a context of undergraduates all over the streets and the demographic dividends gradually disappearing , college students doing the things workers did , and getting paid the money workers got , why is this worthy of being considered strange ?
especially , there has never been any rule saying that the wages of migrant workers have to be lower than the wages of college graduates , the so called " wage disparity between white collar workers and blue collar workers " being not normal has always been just the presumption of some people .
in the writer 's view , migrant laborers exhaust a huge amount of physical labor every day , their level of hardship is not necessarily inferior to the mind work put out by college graduates , using wages to weight the quality of labor is absurd at its core .
and in singapore , america and many other nations , the wages of those front line workers is comparatively high , and the disparity with the wages of college graduates is comparatively small , and even not second to civil servants .
data also shows that the effect of educational history on wages is comparatively limited .
for example in norway in 2008 , the average monthly wages for each level of educational history were :
those employees holding middle school degrees made 32,760 yuan/month , those employees holding high school degrees made 38,610 yuan/month , those employees holding college degrees made 45,630 yuan/month , and those employees with graduate or above educational backgrounds made 56 , 160 yuan / month ..... .
therefore , the significance of taking college graduates and comparing them with migrant laborers is comparatively limited .
college graduates that have just graduated and the hard and diligently working peasant laborers , the great majority are all in the bottom level of society ,
taking college graduates and comparing them with migrant laborers , besides highlighting that college graduates are as " pitiable " as migrant laborers , it cannot explain any great problem .
what we should truly pay attention to is the ravine between income allocations in society .
for example , we should pay more attention to the disparity between college graduates and migrant laborers with the high income groups of civil servants as well as workers of monopolistic state owned enterprises , it just happens to be these disparities that more markedly display the discordance of income allocation .
i should say , as civil servants that are public servants for the people , in income they should not far outpace industry workers ,
while in reality , this kind of disparity is comparatively obvious , the average income of regular civil servants is not even twice that of minimum wage standards ,
yet in many nations , the disparity between the income of civil servants and employees of enterprises and institutions with that of front line workers and college graduates is not that great .
based on this , paying attention to and resolving these problems of disparity will no doubt be advantageous to lessening the gini index which is staying high .
compared to college graduates , at present we need migrant laborers more !
is their water in your brain ? what is the cost of migrant laborers ? what is the cost of college graduates ? do n't you consider it ? many families have raised a college graduate and are burdened with debt .
if it is just to reach the wage levels of migrant laborers , why the need to go to college , and what need for the state to build these colleges ?
you writing this , have you graduated from grade school ? a series of many tens of thousands per month , tens of thousands per year . if one is wrong it 's a big deal , three or four consecutively wrong , is this a problem with your vision or with your head ?
college , why go there ? , people , what are we even living for , if you use money as the standard for weighing everything in your head , what significance does this then have ,
is the talent cultivated in colleges living for money ? you do n't think of this yourself
this is a state allocation problem , it is encouraging cultivation of more laborers with education ? or is it choking cultivation .
zhongpengxie says , according to his sampling of 100 renowned hot pot enterprises , the results show that all base ingredient inspection reports and seasoning quality inspection reports were passing .
this cannot help but to leave people suspicious , doing this is fishing in troubled waters , relying on the tide of hot being called into question to put out advertisements for a small number of enterprises .
from this you can see just how much public credibility of this kind of quality sample reports can have .
on this point , the actual location surveys , relevant pictures as well as the " guarantee " of the bosses of the hot pot seasoning store of the reporter can show that the relevant explanations are not rumors .
the so called refuting of rumors by zhongpengxie is no more than one example in this .
although this conclusion received the suspicions of relevant departments and associations , however , one survey shows that the great majority of netizens choose to believe elementary school students .
since this is the case , there is no reason not to ask elementary school students to come out and do another survey , and tell the people what the truth is after all , saying this is not entirely a joke .
is it that only the innocence of children can ensure product quality ?
the people have been tricked into being afraid .
still deceiving the consumers , where is their conscience ?
the current condition of retirement in china leaves people worried , the costs of private nursing homes are expensive , public nursing homes are severely insufficient , and there are many problems with retiring at home .
not being affordable , not being able to get in , and where retiring to is becoming a great worry for the senior citizens of cities .
social development should be both good and fast , it needs both the even progress of gdp and infrastructure , as well as the areas of social insurance and public services ,
sometimes , when things slow down it is not necessarily a bad thing , and can allow us to shore up the short areas ; after all , this decides the quality of economic development .
the warm winter sun shines on the foot of xiangshan park , and after continuous tides of winter weather , beijing 's temperature has already begun going up again , this has also allowed the bustling of the surroundings of xiangshan to return to that of days past .
however , all of this seems to have little relation to the senior citizens of a nursing home nearby xiangshan -- in their world everything is peaceful .
senior citizen li fengqing 's old companion serenely sits on an aimujia nursing home wheel chair leaning on a cane , this 83 year old senior citizen has begun to lose his memory ,
its only occasionally that he 'll be able to remember the wartime past of going south to guangzhou to build guns and cannons , most of the time , he just peacefully sits like that ..... .
behind these two extremely lonely senior citizens is a group with numbers that are enlarging by the day :
as of 2009 , the population of those over 60 in china had reached 167 million people , accounting for 12.5 % of the total population , and accounting for 1/5 of the population of senior citizens in the entire world , becoming the first nation where the population of senior citizens has surpassed one hundred million .
according to forecasts , as of 2035 , for every two senior citizens , there where be only 1 child .
the rapid increase of the senior citizen population poses a severe challenge to china 's social security , medical security and social ethics .
that the current condition of retirement in china leaves people worried can be seen from the severe incapability of city and town nursing homes in satisfying the daily increasing needs of aging .
the costs of private nursing homes are expensive , and public nursing homes are severely insufficient , and there are many problems with retiring at home .
during interviews , this reporter felt that for a period of time starting now , if a chinese style resolution to retirement difficulties is not found , the most romantic matter may not necessarily be slowly growing old with your partner .
unaffordable --
the environment of privately run nursing homes are good , but prices are too high
at the foot of xiangshan park , you can look up from the aimujia nursing home , which has been established for two years , to all the scenery .
it is a privately run nursing home organization of a fairly large scope in the beijing region , and is fairly representative .
on the afternoon of december 17 , the reporter went to this nursing home .
in this place , time seems to coagulate . looking at it , this was more like a vacation location .
the windows of the two western style hotel buildings were bright and clean .
in a model standard room , there were placed two simmons beds , with a nightstand between them with a fixed line phone on it , as well as emergency response sensors .
a tv hung on the wall , an air conditioner , a bathroom , and even a balcony . you could say , there was everything here that a hotel would have .
worker liu jingmei told the reporter that a room like this was over 5,000 yuan a month , not including meals .
here , there were two doctors and a nurse that were exclusively responsible for the health of senior citizens , and measuring blood pressure and other routine health indexes for the senior citizens every day .
24 hours a day there are specialists on duty , and they closely monitor the sensors .
this kind of nursing home even has rooms that go for ten thousand yuan per month , with decorations that are all palace-style , european style arm chairs , wall fireplaces , high end bathing rooms , with two bedrooms in all , and two bathrooms .
large balconies , independent courtyards , equipped with rocking chairs .
senior citizen li fengqing told the reporter that she was extremely happy with the environment and service here , " but speaking truthfully , it 's a bit expensive . "
li fengqing 's ancestral home is hebei , and she was a teacher for several decades at a central primary school in guangzhou , her old companion was formerly a high level engineer of the 6th mechanical division , and went south before liberation , and was now retired ,
she has four daughters , two in guangzhou , one in macau , one in beijing .
because husband and wife were northerners , they still liked the lifestyle and food of the north more , and thus returned .
li fengqing said , when they first came here , they lived at their daughter 's place , and their son-in-law was very good to them , but everyday their grandson had to play piano , and played inside the apartment for the great majority of the day .
the two senior citizens could not endure this , and also were afraid of disturbing their grandson practicing the piano .
the two senior citizens would sit in the apartment all day , and often kept in their anger , big eyes facing small eyes .
thus , they moved to their son-in-law 's villa in changping , however , with only them and a helper in the spacious villa ,
" we did n't have enough people to play mahjong , and furthermore my old companion is gradually losing his memory , he needs to speak more with people . "
thus , senior citizen li fengqing found this place for retirement .
they plan to live here until spring festival , and have not made a final decision as to where to live .
according to introductions from secretary liu of the nursing home , this nursing home only takes senior citizens that have the ability to care for themselves . its prices in beijing are considered a bit above mid-range , and cannot be said to be expensive .
the reporter learned that , the senior citizens living here were a fairly high-end group , and respectively came from xiehe hospital , xinhua news agency , and retired teachers from beijing and other cities ' schools of higher education .
cannot get in --
beds for public nursing homes are tight , and you ca n't get in at all
separated by only a wall from aimujia is the xiangshan senior citizens apartments , this is a public nursing home under the department of civil affairs .
looking at its outer appearance , its environment and facilities are quite removed compared to those of the newly built aimujia .
that afternoon , the main gate was securely locked , and behind them was locked a wolfhound that wildly barked incessantly .
according to introductions from the people that live at aimujia , they at first thought about going to a public nursing home ,
because in the minds of these senior citizens , the state would do things properly , and the costs of less than 3,000 yuan a month were fairly small .
but as soon as they asked , they could n't even get in line .
" you have to get into line to go to a public home , the beds are too few , and once you get in line , you have to wait until two years later . " 78 year old senior citizen liu tianqing told the reporter .
too few beds is the main cause brought up by senior citizens as to why public nursing homes are hard pressed to resolve their problems ,
however , liu tianqing , this former beijing university professor , told the reporter that the service quality of public nursing homes is also a big problem .
his single child is currently in america , and they are not willing to go to america .
therefore , after he retired , he very soon moved into a nursing home , at first he went to a home declared a model public nursing home located in qijia huozi , beijing .
" when i moved in , i discovered is was far different than what i thought before , i ate one meal from their cafeteria , and had diarrhea for half a month . " liu tianqing indignantly said ,
meeting with the head of the home was impossible , a senior citizen fell down in an elevator , and a office supervisor did n't even bother to look as he walked by .
although the reporter could not verify if what the senior citizen said was exaggerated or not , however , you can imagine , he definitely had unhappy experiences at that nursing home .
according to my understanding , beijing currently has less than 40 thousand beds for nursing homes , only accounting for 1.5 % of the senior citizen population above 60 years old , and in developed nations this proportion is 5 to 7 % .
resolving the difficulties --
breaking the situation of chinese style retirement requires a chinese style resolution
liu jingmei is a worker at aimujia nursing home , she was born in 1987 , and graduated just half a year ago .
although she really loves the nursing home career , however , she does n't plan to have a plan to take her own father and mother into a nursing home in the future .
she told the reporter that the senior citizens that come here all have a certain degree of education , but not all of them can change their thinking ,
however , all those fathers and mothers sent in by their sons and daughters , these senior citizens regularly are depressed , while those that came of their own volition have relatively peaceful emotions .
china has a tradition of placing importance on family bonds and unity ,
in china 's values , sending your parents to a nursing home , or a senior citizen choosing to go to a nursing home himself , at least at the present , cannot be said to be something that follows rationally .
although there is a good deal of families that do not have the conditions to take care of the retired at home .
" i would not send my parents to a nursing home , no matter how good the conditions are , i would not let them go , no matter how good the nursing staff is , are they better than family ? " qi yang , who worked at a foreign enterprise , told the reporter .
however , he also knows that this attitude looks more like the attitude of a slogan when compared to the reality of society .
because he will soon face the common reality of two of the younger generation taking care of four of the older generation .
he and his wife just paid 800 thousand yuan to buy an apartment , and after paying 6,000 yuan a month , it is already very hard to make ends meet , and very hard to bring his parents over from his old home in shandong to take care of them .
furthermore , his wife 's parents have retired .
" two of the younger generation taking care of four of the older generation is the most difficult retirement situation in china , " beijing university sociology professor xia xueluan told the reporter .
more and more well informed people believe that the chinese style retirement difficulties must find a chinese style resolution .
some people have put forth that community retirement is likely a path that meets the retirement situation of china 's cities fairly well .
different from traditional living at home retirement and retirement to nursing homes , " community retirement " mainly relies on the residential retirement network and volunteer retirement services provided by the community besides receiving the care of family ,
it has both the advantages of home retirement and social retirement , and is considered the most feasible option at the present .
national cppcc committee member he xiaoping said , " senior citizens live at home , but retirement services are instead provided by society .
senior citizens both remain in a familiar environment , and also receive care for their livelihoods and spiritually . "
yang chao , also a national cppcc committee member , believes that social retirement is an important supplementary form for family retirement ,
and includes the advantages of medical service specialization , community scale systemization , and low resource allocation costs , and can better satisfy the basic retirement needs for china .
under the setting sun , senior citizen li fengqing woke up her old companion who had fell asleep to signing ,
she said that the memory of her old companion who originally designed guns was becoming worse and worse ,
and to avoid causing him worry , she often tells him they only spent 2,000 yuan to come to live here .
" our lodging expenses are only 2,000 yuan , you do n't need to worry . " li fengqing said loudly into his ear , " we have an apartment , yet spend 2,000 yuan to live here . " her old companion would mutter ..... .
* interview notes
caring for the old is caring for ourselves
in the interviews , i always had this feeling : social development is truly fast , so fast we do n't have time to see it ,
there are some special groups and issues that have already appeared , and we have still not prepared to deal with them .
the " swell of seniors " that soon will or has already arrived is this kind of problem .
can this whirlwind developing society of ours slow down its pace just a bit , and review the process of excessively fast development ,
is n't there some things that are more important than cold hard numbers ,
such as following up on social benefits , such as more reasonable distribution of income , such as the education of the children of the floating population , and also such as the senior age group that will likely have nowhere to go that is appearing en masse .
a worker at the haidian bureau of civil affairs told the reporter , entirely relying on the government to take care of retirement is not realistic and not scientific , and we need to open up levels , and rely on market capital investment into retirement .
these words are the truth .
its just , it seems we 've had the same games in medicine and health and related fields , with that contracted by the government being entirely handed over to the markets ,
and with the state of the nation at present , it seems that two extremes have already proven the results are not ideal .
at present , in the medical education field where the problems are fairly severely exposed , a return to public welfare and civilian run public assistance reforms have already become a consensus , and are progressing smoothly .
and the problem with retirement has instead seemingly only begun to be paid attention to , even though there are so many lessons from before , we need to figure out a resolution policy for the problem as soon as possible .
let us slow down our pace just a bit , and seriously review this problem which will not actually appear immediately but that every person will soon face .
the price of privately run ones are high , and sometimes the excessively for-profit service will go bad , while the government contracted planning system is even more backwards , and has no efficiency .
some experts have pointed out community retirement and bringing in social volunteers is a way , and the state should give support .
behind all of these measures , we have to have an attitude that social development should be good and fast , we both need gdp , infrastructure and also social security and public service areas to progress together ,
let the pace of society slow down , show more care for the old , caring for their today is also caring for our tomorrow .
so you cannot blame a lot of the common people for holding to concepts of raising a son to care for their old age .
ugh , as to this graying society , how are we supposed to reflect on this again ?
bring up your son well , spend your days with your son
for retirement , we must fight ! the so called " if you do n't work hard when you 're young and strong , you 'll just be sad when you are old " is true
commodity prices are high , we ca n't afford it ; retirement is hard , we ca n't getting old ; gravesites are expensive , we ca n't even die ..... . omg !
graying has accelerated . retirement has become another major problem for the nation !
strengthening social security is an extremely important topic !
before the scandal of " asparagus pill profits of 1,300 % " at the hunan xiangya no. 2 hospital had even settled down , its records were easily broken :
a medicine called " ondansetron " which is used to treat cancer as well , the profits verified by the shaanxi province bureau of commodity prices was actually as high as 2,000 % .
on the shaanxi province bureau of commodity prices ' website , the highest retail price of one ondansetron was 84.80 yuan .
yet the cost of its raw materials is less than one yuan , when you add packaging as well as wages , management and other fees , the costs are still less than four yuan .
no matter if it 's the 13 times profit of asparagus pills in hunan of the 20 times profit of ondansetron in shaanxi , these were all verified by commodity price departments , and the hospital is only a small " shareholder " in the overall profit chain .
therefore , after the " sky high priced asparagus pills " were revealed , even the spokesperson for the xiangyua no. 2 hospital who was at the front of the wave of the incident dared to frankly and unabashedly point out :
" we hope the media does well in analyzing this matter , and even revealed the entire profit chain , and showed exactly who is taking the huge profits from these medicines ! "
ha ha , so who in the end would not dare to reveal the entire " profit medicine " chain ? the xiangya no. 2 hospital counts as a army of the government .
yesterday , the ministry of health brought out five measures to control high pharmaceutical costs .
however , the writer believes that these measures have nothing fresh at all , because these measures have always been put forth before by relevant departments .
even if five measures could be excellently implemented , however , as for medicine costs , if the nearly idiotic commodity price departments cannot cooperate well , and set the asparagus pills at 30 or 40 times profits , would n't the pharmaceutical representatives , doctors and hospitals still welcome it just the same ?
this is just like the development and reform commission lowering medicine prices over 20 consecutive times , with the scope of the largest price drop even surpassing 60 % , and the total scope of price drops surpassing 30 % ,
however , after a period of time , you discover that the overall pharmaceutical expenditures of patients is even higher than before the price drops .
why is this ? because the medicines that the development and reform commission announced large scope price decreases for will disappear from hospitals or pharmacies very fast ,
and then another medicine with the same ingredients but a different name , or the same name but different packaging will replace it , and the prices will be a lot higher than before the development and reform commission adjusted prices .
who approved these medicines with " the same ingredients but different names , or the same name but different packaging " to become " new medicines or special medicines ? "
this was the first minister of the state food and drug administration zheng xiaoyu and the greedy team he brought out .
besides this , doctors , as an important point in the interest chain , cannot be ignored .
today , " xinhua news agency " published an article " kickback lists of liaoning 's no. 1 hospital exposes that doctor 's kickbacks account for two tenths of medicine prices " revealing that , recently , a list of medicines used was exposed in an online forum :
" each time a medicine by the common name of aztreonam was prescribed , doctors got a kickback of 6.5 yuan . "
furthermore , surprisingly , the hospital on the " kickback list " was ningbo 's no. 1 hospital that had just won the title of " advanced entity for the 2009 ningbo city health drive construction . "
furthermore , according to that revealed by the retired and reinstated directing doctor of that hospital li wei , there were rules for the use of antibiotics , and this was likely a second line medicine , second line medicines are not the first choice .
" only when patients have side effects with cephalexin , penicillin or other antibiotic medicines would you consider using aztreonam . "
the writer conjectures that aztreonam should be a type of upgraded antibiotic , and cannot be used casually .
however , the attraction of the 20 % " kickback rate " objectively existed with doctors ,
without any relatively severe punishment measures for doctors who " take kickbacks " at the present , in front of such huge interests as this , doctors ignoring their professional ethics , and ignoring the disastrous effects brought about by the abuse of antibiotics becomes hard to avoid .
therefore , " high medicine prices " are actually a microcosm of china 's corruption phenomenon .
with so many managers of medicine , the majority are interest holders in the corrupt chain , they have now long held soft knifes to " kill the chinese , " prominently showing the maladies of ineffectiveness of government management , and the ineffectiveness of punishing corruption .
the common people are waiting to die because of the " high medicine prices , " in reality this is a humiliation of the government .
in view of this , controlling " high medicine prices , " and although " killing a batch " of officials that are committing malpractice and malfeasance and even act evilly in collusion with traitorous businessmen is extremely necessary ,
however , what is more important is that we must still throw off the department interests , and implement the state seeking bids for production of basic pharmaceuticals , the state setting prices , and thoroughly abolish circulation domains for medicines , allowing pharmaceutical enterprises to directly provide goods to hospitals and pharmacies .
the problem of high medicine prices is not a problem with the pharmaceutical companies , pharmaceutical representatives , hospitals and doctors . instead , it is a problem with the current pharmaceutical system , and a problem with compensation for officials .
the currently implemented pharmaceutical system is a corrupt system , from commodity pricing from the food and drug administration to the prescriptions of doctors , which link does not have its commissions and kickbacks , when this money is all added onto the medicine , is there any way it ca n't be expensive ?
what is the basis for the guiding prices of the state development and reform commission ? why are some of their guiding prices even higher than retail prices on the market ? is n't this worthy of our deep reflection ?
from this you can see that without these kickbacks and commissions , where would their grey income come from ?
and how would their living standards be improved .
officials do n't spend money when seeing doctors or taking medicine , if officials had to spend money just like the common people to see doctors or take medicine , the problems of it being difficult to see a doctor and expensive to take medicine would be easily resolved .
thus , when the year will arrive when the common people can truly be able to afford medicine is still an unknown .
will the government bring out its heavy guns to control " high medicine prices ? " i do n't believe so anyway .
phenomenon like this are also created by poor societal mood , a common saying goes , if the upper beam is not straight the lower beam is crooked , the arch-criminals here are those that a high above all else embezzle and receive bribes and are opportunistic and this instead create divisions ,
if this societal cancer is not eradicated , the societal mood will not be good .
thus i say taking hold of the problem you have to take hold of the core , and in pulling out weeds you have to pull out the roots .
when treating an illness not treating the cause and just treating the symptoms , when will it ever be cured ? does this concept need to be talked about every day ?
here , i give a piece of advice to those people who embezzle and take bribes and plot to win ill-gotten gains , you must immediately stop and reform your evil ways .
because all of that money is ill-gotten wealth , and those people that have gotten rich with this will sooner or later face retribution , and this may likely happen to their elders , it may likely happen to themselves , and may also likely happen to their children and grandchildren .
in summary , all of this ill-gotten wealth will be entirely lost .
the medicines of many pharmaceutical factories are highly profitable , and every pharmaceutical factory has specialists in charge of giving kickbacks to doctors , and they even call it academic dissemination , and those who do n't give kickbacks to doctors , they wo n't proscribe their medicines .
pharmaceutical factories are just a way when there is no other way
furthermore , information feedback from the market shows that although there is the " assurances " of the industry and commerce departments , the sales situation of mushrooms is already clearly not anything like it used to be , and some merchants have had no choice but to temporarily stop selling mushrooms .
however , in reality , there are things even more hilarious than the habitual denials - the condemnations of some officials when facing the public and public opinion after major public incidents lack the courage to directly face their mistakes , and instead have the skill to spin bad things into good things , and change criticisms into self praise .
however , at the accident investigation group establishment meeting convened on december 8 , mianchi county people 's government vice county head wei baoyuan instead " spared no trouble " in carrying out self praise when reporting on the work , there was no lack of beautiful rhetoric such as " densely arrange deployment , " " fiercely capture hidden dangers and investigate , " " strictly implement coal mine safety checks " and so on .
thus , there were many mobilization meetings held , and many conclusion meetings held , and many praising meetings held ; only accountability meetings alone were basically not held , and so no wonder similar safety production accidents occur every year and every month .
one sentence , do n't fear making mistakes , fear not admitting mistakes , and then make the same mistakes again .
" rui chenggang steals a south korean media question opportunity to argue with obama : i can represent asia , " reading this report , i did not feel the weakness of obama , but instead felt that china had another reporter with an imposing manner , senseless and widely arrogant .
those on-site all know that there is order to answering reporter questions , otherwise would n't it become as chaotic as a pot of rice porridge .
however , this reporter rui actually did n't know the rules , and disregarding the objections of president obama , still continued to not let things go , and following this tried to convince south korean reporters , and did n't know or did n't care about the consent or non-consent of south korean reporters , he just had to represent asia in asking some questions to president obama .
you are too stubborn , you displayed the overbearingness of big china , if you now can represent asia , i think that the chinese politicians in beijing at this time would not dare say this , you dare to say it , do you think this was on china 's land , and there was nobody to argue with you .
you are a reporter of cctv , you can only represent all of china , but you forgot this !
china and south korea are not on such good terms as to not distinguish between each other , and not separate chinese as outsiders ?
you are too stubborn , so stubborn as to cause chinese to look at you in a new light , so stubborn as to totally lose the image of chinese in your hands , widely arrogant and conceited , faceless and shameless .
you should apologize to the media of the entire world , and china should explain that rui chenggang , he does not represent china !
every time , watchers never felt there was anyplace incorrect or unreasonable at all .
when did china become the spokesperson for asia ?
this world has rules , and we are following them , you are a reporter , if you do not follow the rules , will people accept interviews from you ?
the reporters of cctv , if you are stubborn domestically , nobody dares oppose you , but if you go abroad , this stubbornness , you lose face and look really bad !
and cause people to laugh until their teeth fall out .
asked well !!!
i figured him , chenggang
for what reason does it have to be a partner of america to pose a question
chinese are too quiet and reserved , rui chenggang has given strength , i support him .
so strong we are stupid .
we should be hard-line , and highlight the demeanor of a powerful nation
the poster is losing his own face , nobody is helping you lose it , go and pick it up yourself !
rui chenggang , please do n't represent anybody in speaking again
i think that when chenggang was posing his question , he did not steal the microphone , he raised his hand and was allowed to ask a question , and raising a question that represented asia was more appropriate than one representing china , not like some people , your so-called rules can only get me to disrespect you !
people must have an unyielding character , but cannot have arrogance
rui chenggang , i support you , a lion humiliated for a hundred years , will it actually still continue to sleep ?
the poster 's post quite has the air of the cultural revolution , and if you are not careful enough , he 'll beat you with a big stick .
was n't this just raising a question , even if the target was an american president , why the need to blow the issue out of proportion .
well said , is n't china a part of asia ? since the other nations of asia did not make a noise to the americans
the chinese have been quiet and reserved for several hundred years , now that we have risen we need people that are bold like this to say some bold things to show that it is no longer that time when china did n't even have the right to speak in the international community , now , with china as a major nation of asia and the world , it should say some bold things in international venues like this
china has worked hard to be mighty , he should be awarded , so how is it you criticize him !!!!!!!!!
i still appreciate rui chenggang , at least he represented a spirit of boldness .
i expect at the next session he wo n't be there , too bad !
i think rui chenggang was a bit hegemonic , and lacked caution at that venue .
has the poster figured it out or not , at the time obama let a south korean reporter ask a question , but there was none , at this time rui chenggang stood up to ask a question to break the awkwardness .
talent like rui chenggang having the qualifications to represent china and represent asia is neither humble or arrogant , what is with the american president , in front of him he is as well behaved as sun tze .
the people of the world will know as soon as watching , in reality american netizens have already given a response ------ who lost face was their own president .
while some people write articles cursing rui chenggang are only trying to get him to lose face , but the main character has only taken back a little bit of face and that 's all , however , in reality the exact opposite actually occurred , at this moment they have lost even greater face .
i think that any person with a conscience would have done that , right !
if rui chenggang dared to be so straight forward and strong when facing chinese leaders on chinese land , only then would i truly respect him .
however , when he dared to ask why to america , when will he represent the citizens in asking about the benefits for us regular common people ?
i see that the people losing face here , everybody need not say it to know it!@!!
we should push out two reporters . do you remember in the past there was an american female reporter ?
no wonder these past few years america has paid attention to asia as its economy is no good
poster , i have some suspicions as to your status !
if a south korean reporter stood up to say something there , i would n't need you to represent me and my country , i think that the venue would break out in enthusiastic language !
support chenggang
rui chenggang , as a chinese reporter , represented asia in putting forth a question to american president obama , the sentence " i think i can represent asia " has been criticized by some netizens , yelling they have " been represented . "
i have written a " idiot , why ca n't rui chenggan represent asia " on this , to refute certain people posing as being democratic .
here , i have written a supplementary article to tell certain people , sometimes i do n't need your consent , but can represent you .
since fake democratic persons always talk about " representation , " i will take about " representation " in detail .
whether a person can be a representative or not is decided by two major factors , that are his status and the venue .
specifically , status decides the content of representation , and the venue decides the scope of representation .
perhaps certain people do not understand , below let 's give examples to explain this .
in terms of status , if you are a athlete , then you represent the image of the field of sports as well as the level of the sport you are in .
if you are a merchant , then you represent the image of the commercial world .
these contents that you represent do not need the consent of those in the same field as you .
in terms of venue , if you are a person from henan , if you are in henan province , then you ca n't represent people from henan ,
however , if you leave henan province , then you represent the people of henan , and you do not need the consent of other people of henan for this at all .
this is also the case if a person from henan does something bad outside of the province , the media will describe it as " this henan person did such and such . "
changing a venue , if you go abroad , ok , then your scope of representation expands to -- representing all chinese , your every move represents the image of the chinese .
if you make mistakes or commit crimes abroad , foreigners will talk about how the chinese are such and such , and this kind of representation does not need to go through the permission of every chinese .
ok , let 's come back and discuss the matter of rui chenggang representing asia to pose a question .
lets first look at his status , rui chenggang is a reporter . those with a little bit of knowledge about the media all know that reporters represent the public in posing questions , and this does not need to be authorized by the public .
so , rui chenggang has the right to represent the chinese in posing questions .
let 's look at the venue , at a g20 obama news press conference , rui chenggang as a chinese media reporter no doubt represented china in posing a question .
furthermore , because he was the only asian reporter to pose a question on site , then to say he represented asia in posing a question cannot be blamed .
however , many people have mixed up their seeing and hearing , and think they 've " been represented " and thus cry foul , this is really just making trouble out of nothing .
you are a person from henan who obeys the law , but because other people from henan have made mistakes , when other curse that " there is nobody good in henan , " did you allow that person from henan who made mistakes represent you ?
if you are a man , when a female is hurt and curses that " there is nothing good with men , " did you allow that man who hurt her to represent you as a man ?
they do n't need it at all , but can still represent you !
therefore , looking at rui chenggan representing asia in posing a question , you cannot ignore his status as a reporter and the venue the question was asked in .
if you understand this principle , and still attack rui chenggang , then you are really confusing right and wrong .
in reality , arguing about whether rui chenggan can represent asia or not , at its core is not with him posing a question , and is with the question he posed .
looking at the question that he posed , there is no doubt he represented asia in posing it .
finally , please everybody discuss this reasonably .
follow-up question : did the vice minister that died from a fall in hunan " die from leisure ? "
the bathing center on the fourth floor of the hotel has already been sealed off
at 9 in the morning of november 7 , xiangtan city commerce bureau vice minister zhou qihan 's corpse was discovered in a long and narrow back courtyard of the backstreet of that city 's zhicheng shangwu hotel
some people have declared that this certain zhou died from falling from a window on the 4th floor of that hotel .
the 4th floor of the hotel is a leisure center , with " singing hall , massage , leisure , bathing " posted on its entrance .
at present , that leisure center has already been sealed off by the civil police .
status of the decedent :
the decedent zhou qihan was 55 years old this year , and was employed at xiangtan city 's bureau of commerce ,
at the bureau he separately managed designated butchering of live pigs , market operations adjustments and commercial information and so on ,
his wife worked at the xiangtan city sasac .
zhou qihan lived near the zhicheng shangwu hotel ,
the hotel is 5 stories high ,
behind the hotel there are two small courtyards ,
with a encircling wall two people high built around the outer edge .
those familiar with the minister who fell to his death said , " we hear this guy was very down to earth , and did n't have any scandals .
" there were also netizens who wrote posts saying , " i was a neighbor of his , he was a very agreeable person . "
" it 's very sad , unimaginable ! "
a worker from the xiangtan city bureau of commerce 's offices said ,
" last friday , when chatting with office coworkers , he was all smiles , and you could n't see anything wrong with him . "
cause of the fall to death :
according to eye witnesses , the clothes and shoes of the decedent were all in order , there were no injuries .
nearby residents revealed that in the early morning of the 7th , he heard a " plumph " sound from a distance ,
and actually thought that something was thrown from above , only the next day did he learn a person had fallen .
a security guard of the hotel said that at a little past 8 in the morning of the 7th , a contracted worker was the first to go to the corner of the wall in the back of the courtyard to look at a water pump ,
and discovered a male lying on the ground not moving at all , and thus immediately called the police .
" he was wearing clothes and shoes ,
his head and face were entirely blood ,
the other parts were fine , and you could n't find any injury . "
some reporters inquired to the police about the cause of the falling death of that vice minister ,
the relevant personnel of the xiangtan city bureau of public safety said that ,
" we do n't know , nobody has brought up this matter .
" the reporter followed up asking , " will there be a circular notice on the situation ? "
the other party expressed that ,
" this matter , we just fear it is hard to circulate a notice for . "
rumors popped up everywhere :
the decedents clothes and shoes were in order at the scene , but no injuries ,
robbery can be excluded , revenge killing likely .
the decedent fell from the leisure center on the hotel 's fourth floor ,
did the vice minister " die from leisure ? "
the police 's " this matter , we just fear it is hard to circulate a notice for , "
this has all given endless fanciful thoughts to netizens .
some people say that vice minister " zhou qihan likely went to the leisure center for ' leisure , '
and upon hearing police car sirens , thought the police were coming to investigate the rooms ,
and thus lost himself , and then slipped from the 4th floor window , was not careful and fell to his death . "
the rumors of a cause of death spread widely among netizens !
follow up on the actual facts :
it has been four days since hunan vice minister zhou qihan fell to his death to today ,
why has there not yet been an official announcement of the actual facts to the public ?
if you are upright you do n't fear your shadow being crooked ,
the eyes of netizens are snow-white ,
we will not wrong good people , and will also not let bad people go .
the rise of rumors and the lack of the actual facts ,
the police 's covering things up has also become a hotbed for rumors about the vice minister .
some netizens say , " rumors stop at the actual facts . "
they should give an objective , credible explanation , and avoid rumors rising everywhere .
however , as of the present , there is still no official explanation , and people cannot but randomly conjecture . "
i strongly appeal to the hunan police to announce the actual facts of the matter soon , and stop the rising rumors ,
give netizens an explanation , and return innocence to minister zhou !
i fear the actual facts will not soon come out !
at any rate , he 's dead and there 's no verification !
if this was an accidental death , why do n't they announce it
why do you have to go to such a high priced venue like this hotel to bath ?
there is some type of subconscious motive in the brains of this guy .
too much !
ugh ..... ..... . it 's just best to live your own days !
our leaders need to relax , need consolation
we cannot just because it was a " vice minister , " and " singing hall , massage , leisure , bathing posted on its entrance " and " his wife worked at the xiangtan city sasac .
" and steadfastly conjecture towards bad places .
since " we hear this guy was very down to earth , and did n't have any scandals . " or he was a very agreeable person , you could n't see anything wrong with him . " it is enough to show this was a good person .
furthermore , " the clothes and shoes of the decedent were in order , " this was definitely a good person .
when some reports inquired into the cause , the relevant personnel said " we do n't know , nobody has brought up this matter . " is also normal .
the reporter followed up asking , " will there be a circular notice on the situation ? " the other party said , " this matter , we just fear it is hard to circulate a notice for . " i think they answered correctly .
because rumors arose everywhere : the limitless fanciful thoughts of netizens .
this is the custom of the idle talking too much ,
but when speaking you must seek the truth ,
" did the vice minister " die of leisure ? "
" we can only say that the present netizens are no good !
and have no culture , before there is a conclusion , the vice minister is innocent ,
we do n't need to stroke the flames !
could it be he was too clean , blocking the path to riches of others and was done in !
how can it be judged that he jumped himself , or lost his footing , or was thrown out by others ?
at any rate , there are too many questions ?
first of all , do n't make any positive or negative evaluations , and roughly analyze it :
the decedent 's home was near the hotel ,
even if the decedent had a love of " leisure , " but as a person of official status he cannot but take into consideration a certain effect here , and so he perhaps could have been " taking prey away from his home . "
there are many other questions ,
and those are matters for the people on the case .
big guy ! wash up and go to sleep .
it is very likely he was too clean ,
and was secretly knocked off by others ,
and then this was blamed on him ,
saying he died of leisure at that kind of place ,
in the end , not even mentioning there being no verification of his death , his family could not even hold its head up ..... .
the minister died under flowers ,
he should be buried in spring breezes ,
he 's hard pressed to escape the suspicions of impropriety .....
dying in that kind of place
you cannot avoid all types of conjectures from people
alas , it is pitiable , another good leader has left .
do you say this society is good ?
died of comfort
he went looking for pheasants [ wild prostitutes ] and was scared to death
these years , alas ..... . .
july 2010 , tang jun was wrapped into a false transcript incident , fang zhouzi used strong evidence to show that the diploma that tang jun obtained was a diploma from a bogus college in america ,
public opinion and the public carried out fierce discussions concerning tang jun 's fake diploma ,
and the tang jun incident brought deep reflection to society .
on october 30 , 2010 , tang jun received an invitation to attend the fourth china ceo summit forum and give a speech , in his speech , tang jun did not feel that his own actions were wrong , and refused to apologize for this .
once the incident came out , it once again garnered hot discussion among netizens .
in " the shawshank redemption " there is a passage like this : " there is a kind of bird that cannot be caged , because it 's wings are too beautiful ! "
in our world there is also this kind of person , he is an eagle , his mission is to fight the heavens , yet he lacks a wing ,
to obtain the wings of an eagle , he 'll likely need ten years of time to fight .
however , just when a pair of pheasant wings are placed by his side , the smart him will take up the pheasant 's wings without any hesitation at all and put them on his own body , and he 'll fly up ,
and fly very well , flying so that everybody bows in worship .
although his methods of success may be a bit disreputable , it 's not like han xin bearing disgrace and a heavy burden in creating his own personal epic ,
i personally believe tang jun 's actions of falsely borrowing a diploma do not count as deception , most importantly is that tang jun did not do something against his conscience , and did not infringe the interests of others , and i think he does not need to apologize .
if you were that eagle , you originally should be part of the blue skies , or say you are the young tang jun , but behind you , you lack that passport diploma that would allow you to stride past the threshold of the club of the elites , what would you choose to do ?
would you be like duke jiang and fish on the banks of the wei river , and tranquilly wait for the right moment to arrive ?
would you be like han xin and bear disgrace and a heavy burden and fight for ten years ? or would you be like tang jun and invest in a bogus diploma ?
recently , the general office of the central committee published the " 2010-2020 cadre education training and reform outline , "
it should be said that this is the central government further implementing the spirit of the 17th session fourth plenary meeting , and another major move to thoroughly further a marxism study type party construction ;
it is tightly joining together the reality , and following the tide of reforms , to put out another major deployment .
the education and training of cadres involves the practical reality of every administrative cadre , and concerns the growth and improvement of every cadre ,
while administrative cadres , as the collective that exercises public management power in place of the public , the growth and improvement of each cadre is also related to the development and long term progress of our party and all concerns of the people .
therefore , although this is only a cadre education and training single item outline , this is actually truly important , and is worthy of our close reading .
the entire document is 7,432 characters , systematically describing the direction of reforms from the 8 aspects the importance and urgency of cadre education and training reforms , the guiding thinking of the reforms , the basic principles and main targets , educational system reforms , operating mechanism reforms , method of content reforms , teacher management reforms , macroscopic management reforms and strengthening organization leaders in 29 clauses .
the number of characters is short , its language polished , its measures specific , carefully reading it you 'll have 5 initial feelings .
the first is the targets of reform are more clarified .
it uses five " formations " to specifically explain reform targets ,
establish and improve a " more open , more energized , more truly effective cadre education training system with chinese characteristics by 2020 , "
with clear targets , and confirmed direction , pointing out the path of reforms for the base levels , and not having to feel the path across the river , and go forward by faults and stumbles .
the second is the educational system reforms puts even more importance on the reality of the base levels .
educational system reforms require directly going to defined county first-level party schools , and defining a educational setup taking city level party school education as principal , and county level party schools as supplementary .
the facts are indeed like this , county level party schools have often caused a phenomenon of relatively poor quality of education , and students commonly feeling that the results of study being not that great because of limited teacher power , and limited educational venues ,
and thus the philosophy of studying at county level party schools is equivalent to just taking it easy , and eating , and networking is severe .
therefore , the direction of reform primarily taking city level party schools for education is extremely suitable for the reality of the base levels .
the third is infusing more energy into operational mechanism reforms .
the outline defined education and training reforms must be further embodied in training demands , and a competitive mechanism for selecting the outstanding to inspire organization study activities for cadre education and training must be established ,
a mechanism for cadres to participate in training taking organization training as the main and self elective study as supplementary must be established , testing and evaluation mechanisms , encouragement and restriction mechanism , quality evaluation mechanism and several other important mechanisms , all embody that reforms must fully inspire the determination of cadre education and training vitality .
no matter if its encouragement , restrictions , or testing , they all embody the principle of competition , and competition is pressure , and only with pressure can vitality be inspired , this is a common law .
the fourth is that content style reforms have become more imbued with pertinence .
drafting categorized training outlines , improving knowledge systems more suitable for the pulse of the times , and innovating in all types of training methods ;
making short terms , small classes , fast trainings prominent ; spreading specialized questions , case study and simulation education ; changing the traditional " big rice bowl " to an " all you can eat , " the " cramming style " to a " menu style , " and a " forcing me to take " to a " i wish to take , "
amply embodying the specific demands of training being categorized and levelized , and further strengthening the pertinence of training , and improving the actual effectiveness of training .
the fifth is injecting more quality into teacher management reforms .
from the central government to the localities , the current party schools includes uncountable training entities of every kind , however , to truly allow people to feel there is a high level of education , yet that education and training which is useful after studying is not numerous .
especially the strength of teachers in county first-level party schools is weak , and educational levels are not high , severely affecting the training quality and image of party schools .
thus , the reform outlines clarify that the teacher makeup of cadre education and training entities for levels below city ( local ) levels will gradually transition to concurrent teachers in the main ,
this is to allow those experts , scholars and leader cadres with real knowledge to come to the podium and act as an example to others , using real experiences to lead theory , and produce a better educational effect .
we await expectantly the better and better cadre education and training reform path that the " outline " will lead us on in the next 10 years and even longer , changing actual effects , and training out results , and truly welcoming a brand new spring for our education and training work .
do the best to study , promote true study and true use
chinanews net , reported december 21 , according to the information on chinese government net , state council premier wen jiabao recently hosted the convening of an executive meeting of the state council , hearing and in principle passing the " guiding opinions concerning implementing performance wages for compulsory education schools . "
deciding to implement performance wages for the entire nation 's compulsory education schools beginning january 1 , 2009 , and ensure that the average wage levels of compulsory education teachers are not lower than the average wage levels of local civil servants , while also issuing cost of living subsidies to resigned and retired employees of compulsory education schools .
at the meeting it was pointed out that in implementing performance wages for compulsory education schools , these were specific measures to implement and realize the compulsory education law , deepen the reforms of the income distribution system for public institutions ,

submit
the town 's civil servants reside in the county city , in high-rises ;
the town 's teachers reside in the villages , their roofs leaking and always seeing rainy weather .
the town 's civil servants eat lavishly whether at hotels or the homes of the common people ;
the town 's teacher 's eat at their own homes , cooking by themselves , one saucer of picked vegetables .
the town 's civil servants will not leave their posts to start businesses not matter how they cry ;
the town 's teachers are not allowed to leave their posts , and when each leaves , he will never come back .
the town 's civil servants plays mahjong at work all day and night , and goes to war for money ;
the town 's teachers teach during the day , and prepare for class under lamplight at night , and are unendingly tired .
the town 's civil servants always are free and unrestrained in their sedans , warm in winter and cool in summer ;
the town 's teachers are always sighing on their bikes which are cold in winter and hot in summer .
when the state opens up registration for the civil servant tests , it is packed with applicants ;
when the state opens up registration for teacher tests , they have few applicants .
if the wages of teachers are not paid attention to , there will be an earthquake in education .
the teacher law was drafted by the people 's congress , and not teachers .
realizing the teacher law is not something that teachers can do themselves , and is a matter of those in power , if they want to realize it they will , if they do n't want to realize it they 'll put it to the side .
i have only seen some teachers " change from education to politics , " and have never seen a civil servant change profession to be a teacher , you can see that the profession of teaching and civil servants cannot be discussed together at all .
teachers by reason should receive respect , what are they blindly arguing about ?
putting teachers and civil servants together is simply a insult to teachers i think , what is the job of teachers ? what is the job of civil servants ?
i admit that in contemporary society there are some teachers that have brought disgrace to the so called gardeners , fan paopao , yang buguan and so on .
but if you are a bit more reasonable we can see that this is a minority after all , an appeal for respect to teachers , this is giving us a foundation for the future .
if the teachers of the past had students that actively went and asked them about knowledge or difficult questions , the teacher would very happily and willingly pass this to the student ,
nowadays , teachers first take their money , several yuan an hour , after you get to my house i 'll tell you then. ,
but the knowledge from tutoring for money in their homes is different , they do n't teach it in the classroom .
compulsory education schools are also like this , the items where teachers can pick up money are many , and of course class supervisors are even more like that .
it 's not that there are n't good teachers , but there are too few .
from ancient times to the present , teachers have always been a sacred profession , we will never forget that those who gave us knowledge , and fostered us to become talents were the hard working , good natured , lovable , and worthy of respect teacher !
the key is realizing it well , and feasibly increasing the compensation of teachers ,
the wages of teachers with us here are not high , and are really quite a distance from the wages of civil servants !
teachers indeed have it very hard , and many teachers suffer from heart disease , and work hard at their jobs !
they are in bad health even when they are young ! quickly increase their wages !
as teachers they also do n't get bonuses , and just dead wages every month ! a village teacher of the henan luoyang area !
teachers first of all are people , and secondly are teachers , thus teachers first must be a profession , and teachers are the people that engage in this profession , they are also getting by to put meat on the table ,
they are not gods , and furthermore are not some kind of spiritual engineers or gardeners of humanity , or any other of a series of sacred things , so do n't look too highly upon teachers ,
however , without teachers , who would culture be transmitted by , so do n't look down on teachers , yet how many people truly respect teachers .
growing wages is a specific measure for respecting teachers , because modern people worship money too much , allowing teachers to become rich first , when teachers have money they will respect teachers when looking at the face of money ,
lately the internet is hotly discussing the government 's research of a proposal to extend the retirement age to 65 years old between 2015 and 2030 , with internet users who oppose it accounting for a vast majority .
lately the internet is hotly discussing the zf research of a proposal to extend the retirement age to 65 years old between 2015 and 2030 , with internet users who oppose it accounting for a vast majority .
what is interesting is that people from college graduates to those soon to retire all have opinions on it . but carefully reading their views , i feel that this thing actually has advantages for everyone , and it is simply that its opponents have not clearly thought about the relationship between benefits and harm .
one . extending the retirement age would not take young people 's livelihoods away
people who have endured to soon retire but have not yet been laid off are basically in with the middle-to-high levels of the labor market , college graduates can not do the things they are able to do . delay retirement is at most will hold up some middle-level employees , that is only the advancement opportunities of middle-aged people over 40 years old now and even people like me over 30 years old . i have not yet complained how can it be the turn of post - '80s generation !
it 's like a company 's leadership working for another few years -- the middle managers ' succession may come somewhat later , but the recruitment numbers of low-level employees will not be reduced .
i do n't care , because when the time comes , my retirement age will also be extended . this way , the time i work at higher levels will not be reduced , but i 'll just hang around a few more years at the middle levels , that 's all . altogether , it equals that i have a few more career golden years without a reason ; it will be like this for young people too -- why not ?
two . extending the retirement age will not increase the burden on the soon-to-be-retirees
the reasons of that woman who complained online was having to pay several more years of pension insurance . unbelievable -- why did n't you calculate how much more money you can earn over these years ?
i can understand if she 's been laid off , but this is just a minority special case . the money the vast majority of people can earn just before retirement far exceeds the money you can get after retirement , so only an idiot would want to retire early !
three . extending the retirement age can reduce young people 's burden of supporting their parents
as the above-mentioned rationale , parents work for a few more years at the time when they can earn the most money , and these extra earnings would possibly be the most important economic resource after they retire . this is equivalent to having one 's children bear the burden of support for five years fewer -- and these five years are precisely the most economically difficult period for one 's children !
if you say you are not successful , and do n't plan to support your elders , it does n't matter -- if i say that extending the retirement age five years allows you to live with the parents ' money five more years , are n't you finally be happy !
if you say you are not successful , and do n't plan to support your elders , it does n't matter -- if i say that extending the retirement age five years allows you to gnaw the old five more years , are n't you finally be happy !
four . this program of gradual reform will not produce a significant impact on the labor market
look clearly -- they wo n't begin to implement it until 2015 , and every three years they 'll extend the retirement age one year , completing the goal of the five-year retirement extension only by 2030 . the grumbling graduates will be over thirty years old when that time comes ; if you still have n't found work then , you ca n't blame anyone !
and that fifty-something woman will have long retired by that time , what the bloody pension insurance to pay !
and that fifty-something woman will have long retired by that time , what p pension insurance to pay !
five . extending the retirement age is the inevitable choice of an aging society
any country 's pension system takes young people 's money to provide for the retired and elderly . however , if there are too manyelderly , it 's a heavy burden on the working population and they cannot provide support , and so the pension system develops a crisis .
the aging phenomenon of china 's population is becoming more serious , and not only is there rapid growth in the population who receive pensions , but the period of support is also lengthening with the lengthening of life expectancy . what to do ?
extending the retirement age can significantly adjust the proportion of providers to dependents .
therefore , this is lightening the social burden of young people , not adding to their burden . this logic is simple !
i strongly advocate that the state should increase investment in the pension insurance system , but the pension system needs sustainable development ,
in the long run , the expenditures of the country come from the taxes on the working population -- in the final analysis , it is still the young people 's money !
so extending the retirement age is beneficial to anyone and to the nation . the burdens of young people , middle-aged people , and people soon to retire are all lightened . retirees can thus improve the quality of life in their old age . why do people still oppose it ?
for the vast majority of the working-class , the time before retirement is the period when they get the highest wages .
make the insurance system good ; retirement should be moved up earlier !!!
the present proposition being put forward to extend the retirement age is established in the " social security funding gap " , solving the " social security funding gap " became the crux of the problem .
revolving around how to solve it , one method some people then have put forward to solve it is extending the retirement age ; as soon as this method was brought up it encountered the opposition of the majority of people ,
this is n't a question of being able to balance the books -- the key problem is that this method does n't work well and has no way to work . it is n't a good way , as it will sacrifice the interests of a considerable number of people .
can we consider the second and third methods to solve the " social security funding gap " ,
according to my understanding , there are still at present a considerable proportion of enterprises which do not pay or pay fewer social security fees . if our labor and social security departments can really bear the responsibility for oversight , expand payment of fees and press forward payment of fees , and the government also mobilizes some funds , they will be entirely able to solve the issue of the social security funding gap .
can you live to be 65 years old ?
at one glance one can see that extending the retirement age benefits civil servants and does not benefit workers .
the real situation is that in a situation where the extant government efficiency has not been fundamentally changed , wages are high , benefits are good , and the work is light , which have decided that the body of civil servants do not want to retire .
some people even modify their date of birth and age for purposes of reaching late retirement . extending the retirement age doubtless is the " gospel " of civil servants .
i actually encourage early retirement
why ?
early retirement has advantages for young people -- it could stimulate the younger generation to work hard and be enterprising ; if people retire at 65 years old , then this leader 's position will be occupied by the same person for five more years , and then these young people will be late by a period of five years to get it ; people 's morale will also dwindle when the waiting time is too long .
it 's just like we often say , you need to frequently swap for some fresh " blood " ,
we can combine different industries ' employment practices and according to one 's health situation , retirement after 30 years of working is generally more appropriate .
professions with strong technical natures but lacking in talent should separately prescribe preferential retention policies according to one 's own wishes .
the retirement system involves the national economy and people 's livelihoods -- it should be based on actual industry practices , and the formulation of policies cannot be done behind closed doors , nor less can it be imposed uniformly .
the retirement system involves the national economy and people 's livelihoods -- it should be based on actual industry practices , and the formulation of policies cannot make carts behind closed doors , nor less can it be imposed uniformly .
attention should especially be paid , under our nation 's circumstances of increasing numbers of unemployed , to that fact that the introduction of a unified extension of the retirement age would be adverse to employment and even more adverse to social harmony . most of the factors behind social unrest are caused by unemployment ! the nation cannot take this lightly !
those who applaud the extension of the retirement age , go to the frontlines at the age of fifty and work for half a year , then come back and put out your annoying talk ; i approve of early retirement
why do n't civil servants contribute to pension insurance ?
this is a big number ; civil servants are supported by the nation , is n't it that one pays a price for any benefits ?
this is a big number ; civil servants are supported by the nation , is n't it that a sheep 's wool grows on a sheep 's body ?
and again , they can issue a sorts lottery and issue a welfare lottery , why ca n't they issue a pension insurance lottery ?
if people can not only hit the jackpot , but also can turn it over as pension fees , i think it attraction is pretty large . you government officials are all pigs -- if you ca n't even think up a simple means like this , what use are you ?
i believe that this approach can solve the pension gap issue -- why do you have to start with extending the retirement age ?
if you approve of this approach , please call for it
i enthusiastically recommend that the person who advocated postponing retirement become a laborer for three years !!!
each locality is different , but it definitely must suit the local situation .
when buffett and gates come host a banquet in china , how can it be so difficult to invite guests ?
on august 4 this year , warren buffett and bill gates , two of the top millionaires in the world , announced that they have successfully persuaded 40 u.s. billionaires to publicly pledge to donate at least half of their own wealth .
at the end of this month , gates and buffett will come to china , to go to a " charity dinner " together with 50 chinese magnates ,
will this " dinner banquet " in the name of charity persuade people to donate ?
which chinese magnates will be invited to attend ? with all these questions , it seems that there 's a new round of influence by china 's magnates ' charity in the undercurrents . ( beijing news , september 5 )
is a " charity dinner " hosted by gates and buffett in china a " grand gate banquet " , which causes such enthusiastic speculation by internet friends and the media ,
somebody among the fifty chinese magnates they invited will reject this " charity dinner " .
gates and buffett are two magnates at the world 's top level ; they have successfully persuaded more than 40 american billionaires to publicly commit to donating at least half of their wealth to charities in their country .
now these two will come to china , and will invite 50 wealthy chinese to participate in a " charity dinner " .
this is not an event for " competition of wealth " , but rather for showing off the consciences of chinese magnates and american magnates ,
who has more love for their own country and people , and care about the living status of the people of their country ?
however , while the two have not arrived china yet , the discussion on china 's internet has been bedlam ; the opinions of the majority of internet friends about the trip by the two people are " negative " -- precisely speaking , they have little hope for china 's magnates .
however , while the two have not arrived china yet , the discussion on china 's internet has opened the pot ; the opinions of the majority of internet friends about the trip by the two people are " negative " -- precisely speaking , they have little hope for china 's magnates .
" these two people are somewhat too naive ! if this was to teach them to speculate in stocks , i guess that they would be proactive without being dragged in ; doing charity makes things too difficult for them ... "
" these two are very admirable , but chinese views of money and society are too different from those of the americans ; moreover , most of the magnates are upstarts without a sense of social responsibility , and they just want to leave their money to their descendants ... "
this was originally a good opportunity for chinese magnates to " rectify their name " , so why have they made netizens trust them so little ?
a media survey shows that the proportion of wealthy chinese involved in charity is very low .
in china , about 75 percent of the annual donation is from abroad , 15 % from the rich of china , another 10 % from the common people ; that from enterprises which are involved in donation and charity accounts for only 1 percent .
displaying these figures makes our emotions towards the rich involved in charity in china go to a extremely low point again .
in some professionals ' analysis , from a subjective point of view , some entrepreneurs believe that wealth is family property and has been exchanged through their own hard production and even their lives ; naturally , they want to leave it to their future descendents .
in addition , one of the reasons is that the social gap between the rich and the poor in china continues to increase ; the general " psychology of hatred towards the rich " of ordinary people makes many magnates not want to reveal their wealth .
second , china 's charity industry system is imperfect , the supervision of donated funds is ineffective , the operation of charity organizations is lack of transparency , the methods of incentives for donors are insufficient and without estate duties supporting them , etc. , these are all the important reasons why the rich people do not want to have charitable causes .
i think that since the above analysis is of objectively existing factors , but it can not rule out the consciousness of another segment of rich people .
because the family history of these people itself has a long record of misdeeds .
for example , some of the coal bosses like those upstarts who operate the black brick kilns and black factories , and for example , some people who rely on tax evasion and fee dodging and on the bribery of national public officials and other familiar unspoken rules to finally acquire wealth , and so on and so on .
if we make these people take money to do charity , it will be like cutting their meat ,
of course , there are some people among them who sincerely want to take out money to undertake some social welfare , but dare they ? what are they afraid of ? we know well .
no matter what , they also have made a " contribution " to china 's gdp .
a series of complex backgrounds make the psychology of the wealthy people in chinese society very contradictory .
therefore , it is not that the two foreign rich people taking a trip to china that will be able to influence the current status quo of the wealthy chinese .
otherwise , it would n't be embarrassing that they had to write a " guarantee letter " of " not persuading people to donate " in order to invite 50 wealthy chinese to participate in a " banquet " .
a high-level person in the shanghai financial filed has made an analysis -- that by this stage , it is probably impossible for china 's magnates to donate half of their assets ; it would be good enough if they can donate 5 % of their assets .
currently , there has only been a period of time of one generation since china started to become rich ; many rich people have an uncertain psychology regarding the economic and business environment ; in addition , pensions , medical , and other social security are not perfect , which inevitably makes the rich people become conservative in giving wealth .
however , the beijing news quoted the words of jin jinping , director of the non-profit organization law research center of beijing university law school , saying that she is very optimistic about the " buffett-bill action " .
" they are already considered to be meritorious , from so many discussions which they triggered when they had not yet arrived in china . "
regarding this , zhou qingan , a research fellow at tsinghua international communication research center , also believes that after buffett and gates come to china , it is possible that they wo n't have influenced very many people into making donations ,
however , it will be a good thing if they can just touch one person , can make one person carry out charitable behavior , no matter how much he donates , no matter what way he uses it .
yes , no matter what various statements are made by netizens on the internet , or what superb speeches the experts make , we should always give more encouragement and more support for the " philanthropic acts " of these two american " elderly " in their trip to china .
i just wonder when there will be a similar " dinner " held by chinese rich people in the united states .
hosting a dinner in the united states ? you 'll wait till you die !
it has somewhat of a taste of compulsion !!! our own wealth , with a just and righteous antecedent , should be decided by ourselves ; from the people , for the people , this is a good thing !!!
